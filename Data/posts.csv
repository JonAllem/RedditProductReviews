Just hit 30 and have been smoking ciggs since 18. The old gf told me either Quit Smoking or she's bouncing because she's tired of me smoking cancer and smelling like an ash tray. Met her half way and bought a VooPoo Drag Uforce off ebay:

Have some questions someone can shed some light on!

1. Is this plug and play? Do I just drop juice in hit?
2. Is there replacement coils I should start buying for spares? If so recommendations?
3. I am not a HxC vaper, I just want to get my fix/lung hit. Are there ritual preparations I should be doing every time?
4. Is the stock tank okay or should I upgrade that to something else? 
5. I am super new to all of this... I've had a Pen which lasted maybe 2 weeks so I gave up on it.
6. Thanks for hearing me out. I'm tired of smoking ciggs and want to make some life changes. This will be my first step in trying to kick my habit!

t3_9ta4mk,Vaporesso Cascade Dry Hits on GTM2,"Hi, I have been using the Vaporesso Cascade Tank for the last month and a half and had a very good experience with it initially. I had first used the GTM2 coil that came with the tank and really liked the flavor since I was using a Vaporesso Veco before this. I am runnin gthe tank on my Vaporesso Tarot mini single 18650 mod.

The first coil lasted me about a week and then I used a CCELL2 GT Core with the adapter. Had no issues with this either. After that I wanted to use the GTM2 because I really liked the airflow and the flavour on it. I opened up the tank, cleaned it out, primed the new GTM2 and put it back together. After using it for a couple of days I suddenly got a nasty dry hit. My tank was 75% full at that time. After digging around on r/electronic_cigarette, I found that someone had been having similar issues and that opening the top fill cap and closing it back sorted it out. Second to last comment here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic\_cigarette/comments/7zuyl9/vaporesso\_cascade\_coil\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/7zuyl9/vaporesso_cascade_coil_life/)

Sure enough, I tried it and it worked. However I am having to do this every 3-4 pulls. When I open the top cap, I can sometimes see a film of ejuice across the filling hole. I clear it out and immediately I can take a full flavourful drag.

Would anyone know what is causing this and any solutions to this if it has happened to anyone else? Also, did I mess up something when I opened it up to clean it? I've cleaned a few times after that and have inspected the O-rings and everything is in place. I get 3-4 good drags before the flavour starts to wear off and after a couple more drags its a guaranteed dry hit, unless I open up the fill cap.

t3_9ta1w0,Two Bricked Orions,"I purchased my first Lost Vape Orion at the beginning of October with high hopes after seeing so many positive reviews about it. I already own 2 Lost Vape products (Therion 166 and Paranormal 250c) so I assumed that it was going to be high quality and perform on the high tier they’ve set for themselves. The mod itself met the high quality build mark that I had hyped myself up for, however not more than 2 weeks in it bricked on me. One minute it’s working and the next it’s dead. After looking through this sub and finding out there’s no fix I got a refund and decided to buy a new one through a different company just in case the one I originally had purchased through had a batch of faulty ones. I received my new Orion on Monday and sure enough I go to use it last night and the damn thing has bricked on me as well. I am more than aggravated and disappointed with Lost Vape and this system especially considering the price. The enticement of having a pod system that offers a DNA board with customizable temp control was too much for me initially to pass up, but having experienced two bricked Orions I will not be giving the system a third chance. I hope they take the time to correct whatever the issue is before they put out any more so no one else has to experience this disappointment with their product.

t3_9t7lm7,The stuff I own the less happier I am with my vaping,"In the last 2 months I spent over 300aus dollars on shit that I actually do not need, because I constantly thing that something is missing or is not just rigth.

Once I got my paranormal 250c, I thought "" thats it I am set"". And I was happy with my set up, made juices bougth coils.

Since I started following this sub I ended up buying.
a breeze2, beserker mtl, orion, salt juice, falcon tank, fireluke pro tank, vaporesso baby ...and coils for them.

The breeze and the  beserker were a disappointment from the start...the orion is most likely to be the same...( the quality of the pods are not worth it).
The Falcon was haven for the period of the first inbuild coil.

Following the hype about the mesh coils, first I bougth the falcon ( i just tossed it in the bin).
With all three tanks I find that the mesh keeps for a very long time the flavour of the previous juice...and all juices taste way to sweet(or is it just me).
Constantly thinking that I have a vapor tongue but then with a new tank I find that ot is OK.

The more stuff I have the less I enjoy vaping..there is constantly something wrong. 

I want back the joy of my first tasting of NET..the joy of the first smok stick...( it lasted only 6 weeks)...the joy of  learning how to do DL.

Rigth now I am at the stage to throw everything in a bag and throw it away...because of all of this i started  to think that the juice are not rigth.
Ordered juices direct from Innawera in 10ml just to see what thw juice should taste like when I use their concentrates and there are the same shit juices that you get from the vendors under different name ( I make only tobacco juices). I have net concentrates, and even they are not good to me anymore.

t3_9t7hz9,Single 21700 Squonk opinions,"Happy Halloween guys. Im looking to take advantage of some of the sales going on and pick up a new squonk mod. I've narrowed it down to 4. They are all very similar and preform about the same so I mostly listed my cons.


Ill be using a Recurve RDA. 21700 battery. I'm a light user. It probably won't leave my house. I dont care about TC at all


**Vandy Vape Pulse X 90:**
I like the look of the mod. Has a lot of sales and positive reviews. Everything seems great, except I've read a few things about leaking, and the recent review about the USB charging.


**Hcigar Aurora:**
a little big. Looks a little plain. I don't like the small rattle and that the doors come off so easily. My worry is this is this won't last long. Great price though.


**Eleaf Pico Squeeze 2:**
Also great price. The most compact, looks well built. don't like the screen or the buttons. I've seen some bad things about the buttons having issues. One question... Is the stainless steel a finish or it is raw stainless steel?


**Dovpo Topside:**
Looks pretty good, and we'll built. Easy to fill, large tank. But almost no reviews. It's large. Also much more expensive.

While I could get the Vindicator as a clone from fasttech, I'm wondering why there seems to be absolutely no clone for the Saint on the entire internet. And I slightly prefer the Saint over the Vindicator.

&#x200B;

So I was wondering if, according to your experience, there is a usual period of time in which you can expect a clone to come out, or if it's just completely random plus a 50-50 chance if a clone comes out at all? Is the Saint still too new to have a clone?

8. Fuchai Squonk 213

My current is the Fuchai, which I use alongside my DROP RDA, and occasionally my Cascade Baby tank (SMOK strip coils).

I just rebuilt my deck properly (I’m quite new to RDAs), and got my first bottle of 0mg juice today. Humble V.T.R, I really love the flavour and the fact that there’s absolutely no throat hit.

This is the first time I’ve come down to 0mg. My previous bottle was 5mg salt nic and a 3mg nic of Illicit juice, so I’m hoping that if I get any withdrawals, I will be able to cope.

I think the biggest part of this quitting thing for me, is saying no when offered, sober or otherwise. 

Thanks for reading this, I also want to thank everyone for the help and advice that has got me this far.

God bless",Wed Oct 31 21:13:02 PDT 2018,garlotch

t3_9t4z6r,Suggestions for a watermelon juice?,"Long story short, Back in 2016 when I first started vaping my Brother had ""Between Jobs"" From Ground Zero. Since then, It's been my favorite watermelon juice and has made me want more. All I've had since then though is some watermelon strawberry. Being that most juice I've had has been strawberry, I wanna stay away from that. I just want to find a really good watermelon flavor, even something close to Ground Zero's as possible. I ordered some juice from Ecig City Thursday night, and they had some $4 juice going on so I got melon by Gooey eliquid. I haven't been able to try it yet since they didn't ship my order until Monday. Kinda infuriating honestly being that I ran out of my more favorable juices and had to go back to Broke Dick, Which after having more premium juice, tastes very cheap to me..

Anyways, Thanks in advanced for any suggestions!

Edit: I forgot to say this in my post innitally, I want to find a juice that won't break the bank. I WOULD buy Ground Zero juice to get that flavor I want, But, a 60ml for $18 is a bit much for me. I've mostly been getting 120ml bottles on sale for $10-$12. (candy king seems to always been on sale when I order.)",Wed Oct 31 18:10:06 PDT 2018,AlienVibez

Most online guides say temp control is common between 200-400c. My device's lowest setting is 150C, which I've been using as I'm finding my present juice quite harsh in the new device. 

Obviously the next juice I pick up will be 70/30 and maybe 6mg, maybe 9mg. Is there any downside to vaping as low as 150C? What benefits do I gain by increasing temp?",Wed Oct 31 18:01:21 PDT 2018,PmMeExistentialDread
t3_9t4rvj,Tips for building SS MTL Coils,"Hello guys. I've been making my own coils for some time and finally decided to give TC a try. Today I bought some SS316L 28ga wire and built some coils for the kits I mostly use (Vzone Cultura 100W + Fumytech Rose MTL RTA and Vandy Vape Pulse 80W + Digiflavor Drop RDA).

I've tested a 2,5 diameter 0.86 ohm coil on the Cultura + Rose kit and although the flavor seemed nicer at first it started to give me a burnt taste pretty quick, even at the lowest temperature available at the mod (100ºC/212ºF). For the Pulse + Drop I've test two 2,5 diameter coils with a total of 0.38 ohms, could't get a warm vapor even with the highest temperature available.

I understand now that building with SS is way different than building with Kanthal and after some research I really got overwhelmed by all the different recommendations I read online. So if anyone could give me some tips on how to build SS coils for MTL/DTL and set up my mods for a better experience I would really appreciate it.

t3_9t4cdc,Problem: Desire Rage Squonk Mod & Wotofo Profile RDA,"Hey there, 

I have some problems with my new setup and i would be very thankful if you have any ideas how to solve them.

Note: This is my first Squonk-Setup, so I thought maybe I did something wrong or you have some suggestions for me. 

Issue #1: The Squonk Bottle itself pushes the juice out perfectly when I squeeze it outside of the mod, but right after putting it in, it takes around 10-20 seconds of constantly squeezing the bottle to get any juice out of the pin, same issue if any RDA is installed. 


Issue #2: I updated the mod to the recent firmware because of the Wattage issue, but before and after update I get heavy dry hits (or more like burning throat hits) off my Wotofo Profile RDA (even if cotton looks and smells fully saturated) when using the Mesh Coil at 55 Watts and up. Wicking seems to be fine, as this RDA is pretty self-explanatory (and I even checked in the manual if I did something wrong). Normal Stapled Clapton works fine, but I can‘t seem to figure out, what the problem with the mesh could possibly be. 



I would love to hear your suggestions!

The breeze 2 is really good but the bulkiness just doesn’t feel as good to me as a juul does, and also the button doesn’t do much to help with that. I’ve read some estimates from people who’ve gone the refill route that it ended up costing them about ~12 a month to refill, replacing coils for the aspire breeze 2 would be comparable to that cost. Is it worth going the refill route if I prefer the design of the juul, and the cost would still be comparable to a refillable system like the breeze 2?

# First Impressions:

This mod has a very unique design and appearance, it’s also a pretty hefty mod for its size. It’s a cool looking mod but it’s got a lot of weird features really. I don’t like how the shoulders are raised around the 510 connection so that it’s limited to 26mm and under atomizers. The plus and minus buttons are offset so you have to get used to the fact that they aren’t in line with each other. The screen is definitely on the smaller side than I’d prefer as well. The rounded edges are definitely nice which makes it feel pretty good held in hand. The firing bar takes a nice solid press which is always good, it would take a significant amount of force to have it fire off in your pocket or bag. The paint on it is a really nice finish as well, the green actually looks really good but it is my favorite color so I’m a bit biased haha. The whole car engine themed influence is *interesting*, I’m not quite sure I really like it overall and I’d bet most people prefer a more traditional and classic design in their mods. It’s a pretty heavy mod too, the E-Priv empty feels like a similar weight to my Polar with batteries installed; I know some like a heavier mod and others prefer light weight so that’s probably a bit polarizing too. Without batteries installed the battery door has a good amount of play to it but once you put your 18650’s in it’s very solid and doesn’t have any play. Installing batteries can be a bit difficult as well, you really have to put some force on the door to get it to latch shut, you’re going to be using two hands. Overall I feel like it’s a vape made for a very specific type of person, maybe someone really obsessed with V12 engines who wants a mod styled after them. For the average vaper, I just don't think it’s got the appeal a simpler vape would have.  

&#x200B;

# General Use/Performance:

The biggest downfall for me is the fact that it only has power and temp control mode, like the Species mod, there is no curves for either of those modes (no bypass either). Regular power or watt mode works just fine, it’s pretty quick to fire and gives a smooth and consistent experience. It’s got the normal preheat settings as well: soft, normal, and hard. SMOK advertises that it’s got an updated chipset called the ARM-M4 which “employs a larger 32K SRAM featuring more superior performance and shorter operation delay”. The vape fires pretty quickly and doesn’t have any sort of delay when changing settings around, I’m not sure if the Species has the same chip but it didn’t feel any different than that mod in those regards. TC mode didn’t perform nearly as well as the Species did. I set it to my normal preferences for my rta and rda’s and it seemed to need higher temp to give me what I wanted. Normally I vape around 420F but I was setting the E-Priv to 480F to get the same effect. The biggest issue though was that TC feels like it “strobes” almost, not sure what the best word to describe it is. With my Polar mod, TC feels very smooth but the E-Priv was almost pulsing like it was reaching the temp then dropping and continually cycling. It was a lot less smooth of a TC experience than I’ve gotten with most other devices. The Species gave way more consistent TC, so with the upgraded chip I’m not sure why it was behaving like that. I’ll note it’s also got memory modes (1-23) which is something I generally never use. They’re not TC memory modes but regular VW so I don’t really understand the point of it. 

One of my other pet peeves is lack of a mode button, I don’t like having to use the fire bar to change settings around. Three clicks of the fire bar takes you into the various settings for firing mode, puff settings, screen settings, and a power off selection. A quick press of the firing bar will bring you over to the next settings selection and a long press lets you change things in the current setting screen. Puff settings lets you set a puff limit, you can clear the puff counter, and view how many current puffs you have. Screen settings lets you choose from six different theme colors, set your screen timeout (15-240s), and auto lock the mod. The power off screen isn’t too hard to figure out lol. It’s also got various shortcuts to change preheat option, TC/VW mode, and lock or unlock the device while not having to navigate into the settings.

&#x200B;

# TFV12 Prince Tank:

So first I’ll talk about the coils that come with this tank, which will be taken from my Species review since the coils are exactly the same. The V12 Max Mesh single mesh coil is fucking huge. I’ve never seen such a wide center air hole. It also really does need around 90W minimum to vape with it, definitely wasn’t a fan of that. I noticed the mod getting really warm and my battery life took a huge dump. The mesh coil was pretty tasty though and definitely made some large clouds. It drank juice crazy fast too and it started burning out somewhat quickly, for such a hot coil it did well I guess. (I was using somewhat sugary juices for both these coils I’ll note). It was comparable to other single mesh coils included with kits, just supersized. The V12 Dual Mesh coil was miles ahead. I was getting a great vape with 62W, it went through a juice flavor change just fine, and it lasted easily 5 days with great taste. The Dual Mesh isn’t quite mesh, more of a lattice/strip design and it was my first dual mesh/strip coil. I’ve tried a few other mesh coils so far but this dual was better than all the singles by far. I know Smok coils can be hit or miss but both these coils were good, the Dual Mesh was even great I’d say. I have to note as well that the Prince Tank ended up sitting around for a bit after I was done using it and it ended up leaking pretty bad on my cabinet, I even had the air flow closed. Maybe this wouldn’t have happened if I had constantly been using it but I don’t remember other sub ohm tanks doing that.

Overall I do like the look of the V12 Prince tank, and the cobra design drip tip is pretty cool. It’s got the more classic dual air flow setup and offers a ton of air, I usually had it closed off like 40% of the way. Compared to the TFV8 V2 on the Species, it’s not nearly as turbulent or noisy but seemed to offer pretty similar performance in vaping quality. I liked the TFV8 tank a little more overall, both in looks and that tri air flow. It’s not a bad tank by any means and the mesh coils are a big improvement over SMOK’s old sub ohm coils. One other cool feature is the existence of an rba deck for the V12 tank. I really wish SMOK would have included that in this kit and I don’t think the Specie’s V8 tank offers that, no clue how well it works though. I’ll also note that SMOK says they include an anti-slip ring with this kit that color matches the tank but there wasn’t one in my kit. They probably do include it in the retail versions but I was kind of looking forward to that lol.

&#x200B;

# Cons:

\-limited to 26mm and under atty’s 

\-small screen

\-offset plus and minus buttons

\-TC performance was lacking 

\-lack of any curve modes

\-battery door being difficult to close

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

Hopefully this review doesn’t come off as me bashing the vape or hating on it, it’s really not bad for basic use but I wanted to be honest with how I felt about the experience overall. Having been sent both this kit and the Species kit, I think the Species is 100% the way to go. I was actually pretty impressed with that kit. If the colors appeal to you or you’re just a huge fan of V12 engines, then this vape might be literally exactly what you’re looking for lol. Navigating through the settings can be a little funky at first but it’s easy once you know what you’re doing. If you’re the type of vaper who sticks to basic VW mode, then it’s a really solid performer. The included tank is very average overall but the dual mesh coil is pretty good and does a nice job for flavor. Battery life was pretty good and it fires quickly. Overall it’s a very average vape, beyond the interesting appearance it doesn’t seem like SMOK was really trying to push the envelope on this one. 

&#x200B;

*Disclaimer: This kit was sent to me for free by SMOK for the purpose of this review*

&#x200B;

If you read through this then thanks for checking out my review. I know SMOK is usually regarded around here as the spawn of Satan but I think they have improved their QC overall. I kept this as honest as I could and called out what I didn't like. I know there's some who already have this mod or may be limited to buying local and having less options so hopefully at least someone takes any value from the time I put into this. I've got a ton of respect for Anthony and Anxiety, I really couldn't imagine cranking out reviews almost everyday, maybe I'm just a shit writer (pretty much true) but it's a lot of work. Before doing any reviews I envied people getting free stuff and *only* having to write up a review but it's made me realize how much I simply enjoy just relaxing with vaping rather than constantly analyzing it lol.

**Drag 2 Kit First Impressions**

Right out of the box there are noticeable differences between the OG Drag and the Drag 2 as is to be expected. It wouldn't really make much sense to come out with a second version of something if there weren't going to be any changes.

The Drag 2 is a smidge shorter and a little bit smaller from side to side. Width wise it's a slight bit chunkier and actually bubbles out slightly towards the middle and tapers off a bit towards the sides. This allows the D2 to accomodate slighly larger attys than it's predecessor, especially since this one doesn't have that grove that created the unsightly gap on the OG Drag.

Speaking of placing attys, the 510 plate on the D2, as everyone knows at this point, is not really centered and is slightly raised from the device. I have no idea why it's not centered, it's not even centered to the contour. This seems a bit strange, but I'm not getting butt hurt about it like a lot of other people. Whatever, it's slightly off centered. Also, apparently VooPoo have said something about the raised 510 being purposefully done to prevent atty rash. I guess I can buy that. It's not really raised much and is hardly noticeable. I've seen people absolutely go off on VooPoo because of these two things alone. I'm sitting over here like, ""why are we getting so mad about this?"" These aren't really big issues to concern ourselves with. Yes, they might be mild annoyances, but nothing to go on a tirade over.

Moving on.

All around the edges have been smoothed out in favor of some nice rounded corners. This is more noticeable on the screen side of the device and the side opposite to it. A little bit of styling has been added to these portions and it is more of a true rounding of the edges. The rest of the edges aren't necesarilly rounded, rather, the sharp edge has really just been shaved off. All in all this makes for a more comfortable hold.

Another issue I've seen others have that I can speak to is the issue with the battery door. I've seen some extreme cases of battery doors wiggling drastically from side to side. The devices I have don't have the issue quite to this extent, but there is a slight wiggle from side to side towards the top of the battery door. It is definitely something that can be felt when picking up the device and is a mild annoyance. Most of my battery door movement happens up to down. This moves a bit more than from side to side, but is still only a mild annoyance. One more thing about the battery door: it still has DRAG plastered across it. I really thought we were going to get resin battery doors on this one like everyone was asking for. Nope!

Speaking of resin, the resin on the D2 is quite beautiful. I've always loved the resin from VooPoo. It has a soft feel to it, a nice sheen, and some depth. I love the new colors they've put out and am happy they are doing matching drip tips.

When it comes down to performance, I don't really feel comfortable saying too much about it as I've only had the device for a week. What I have noticed so far is that it hits similarly to the OG Drag and still has the 80W cap on TC. As for the new FIT mode, it seems to work okay so far. If you don't know what FIT mode is, it is designed for use with UForce tanks only, recognizes the installed coil and adjusts the output depending on 1 of 3 settings you choose. 1 is supposed to be for battery life and just feels weak. 2 is supposed to be for flavor and just feels less weak than 1. 3 is supposed to be for clouds and is probably the only FIT mode I will use. More testing is required all around to give a better evaluation of performance, so I will go over this in a bit more detail with the full review.

The last thing I want to talk about is the UForce T2 atomizer that comes with the kit. It is styled a bit differently, but performance is right there with the rest of its older siblings. It uses the same coils and pretty much has the same airflow and top fill. Like I said, the only difference is that it looks a bit different. Nothing major to go over there.

&nbsp;

As I said, this is just my first impressions of the kit so far. It ended up being a bit lengthier than I expected, but I wanted to touch on a couple of things I have seen other reviewers talk about. I will continue using the device over the next several weeks and write my standard review at that time.

t3_9t2emo,Got some new coils for my Crown 3 mini and they all taste funny,"They don't taste burned they just taste bad and I can't figure out not.

I keep vaping thinking the taste will go away but it wont!  

I primed the coil correctly (left it about 2 hours!), worked my way up in voltage and I've been using the same juice the past week and its never tasted as bad as this. ",Wed Oct 31 13:11:05 PDT 2018,BillyVanSanden
t3_9t2cms,"New flavour of juice, tasteless?","Hi all,

I was using my VooPoo Drag with Fireluke mesh coils, usually vaping at 60W with Nasty Juice Cush Man flavour and it was great, however I burnt out all my coils and the new ones I ordered haven't arrived yet, so I reverted back to my old innokin cool fire with the iSubG 0.5 coils.

&#x200B;

I put some Vapour Depot A\* Strawberry Chewer liquid in which I have heard good things about, my coil is rated between 20-35w and I have tried every wattage between this range and I just can't seem to taste a damn thing out of this new juice. 

&#x200B;

Surely it can't be vapours tongue, because its a completely new flavour I've switched to. Could it be that the flavour will be better once I get back on my drag with the fireluke coils?

t3_9t244t,Question about ElementVape delivery,"Might be a stupid question, but I figure I should ask. 

I’m over 18 and I’m planning on using a prepaid gift card I got in order to buy a mod on element vape along with some juice. I should also mention I live in Texas (legal smoking age is 18)
 
 I’m in college so I’d be shipping to my campus PO Box. I’ve heard that there is an “adult signature” required on some orders, that would only allow someone 21+ to sign for it. (Which I’m not) But I don’t really understand when that applies.  

So should I be okay ordering from them? Or should I try a different site? And if anyone else has ordered to their campus mailroom, was it a problem whatsoever? ",Wed Oct 31 12:39:25 PDT 2018,Sarcastic-Cynic
t3_9t1z4x,Do added sweeteners slow nicotine absorption into your bloodstream?,"This has been on my mind today. Recently I purchased a bunch of juices from Blue Dot, a brand that I'm told uses little to no sweeteners in their recipes. While vaping these juices, I seem to get a stronger nicotine hit over other brands that I frequent like The Sauce LA and Abstrakt even though I only vape 3mg juices. 

It's the same hit I get from my own mixes, which also have no added sweeteners. So my question is in the name of this thread:  

Do sweeteners increase the amount of time it takes for nicotine to enter your bloodstream? Does anyone else experience a harder nicotine hit when vaping juices with little to no sweeteners? ",Wed Oct 31 12:24:19 PDT 2018,rancidpandemic

t3_9t1qbn,About to get a Steam Crave Titan kit. Check my battery idea and math?,"I'm getting a Steam crave Titan kit (and I'm pretty excited about it). It's a series parallel, which as I understand it takes two pairs of series-wired batteries and treats them like a parallel set? So, stacking the voltage of two while stacking the mahs of the pairs? Meaning, a theoretical 8.4 volts plus the mah x 2 of my battery choice...a 2500 Mah, in this 4-battery config, still only goes to 5000 total mah?

I plan to use the series post in the atomizer, and aim for a 0.40 ohm build. I can't imagine going higher than 7 volts, as that would bring me to 122-ish watts. It comes out to about 17.5 amps. 

As I see this, any decent 18650 that does 20 amps or better is safe, yeah? My thought was the LG HG2. If I can't get those, HE2, VTC5 or the 25Rs should all still be safe. Did I miss anything?

One other question - does a wiring config like this treat the battery pairs as separate sets of married batteries? I plan to get all new fresh sets anyway and marry them in groups of four, I'm just curious.",Wed Oct 31 11:57:59 PDT 2018,malren

---

##**Appearance**

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/Qn8Jvww) - Note the line in the screen anomaly is from my phone and not a defect in the mod.

I was one of those few that didn’t buy a Drag simply because of the looks.  Thankfully the Vmate is a much more refined mod and doesn’t have any giant logos on it.  It reminds me of the Therion in the way it has a retro modern vibe to it.  The body on mine is a polished aluminum and the doors are wood grain with textured black buttons.  It is curvy and sculpted and really nicely designed.  The contrasting black oval panels accent this too.  It is low key and elegant in appearance.  The Voopoo logo is on the back of the mod in reasonably sized text.

The mod is made of Zinc alloy according to their website and overall is very light weight.  The battery doors are plastic and is one of the main things I do not like.  They feel cheap.  They fit into a slot on the bottom of the mod and the top snaps into pace via a magnet.  There is some light play side to side.  All of the buttons are located on the top of the mod is another complaint.  The adjustment buttons are so close together that it’s easy to mix up which side you’re pressing on when passively vaping.  I also have a slight concern with buttons on the top as to what access juice would have to the inside of a mod in the event of a spill.

The UForce T1 tank matches nicely to the mod with contrasting stainless steel with a knurled black ring just under the sliding fill port and the airflow control ring.  It too has subtle design finesse that goes well with the VMate.

---

**Function**

**How it Works** -  The Vmate is mostly devoid of any fancy menu system or color screen.  The OLED screen is bright and simple which works with the wood and SS theme of mine.  The adjustment buttons control wattage or temperature.  Since it adjusts in .1w increments under 100w it takes a bit of finesse to get that perfect setting.  Once it starts speed scrolling, it goes very quickly.  You can go from 40w to 45 in a blink.  An interesting feature is it will adjust wattage automatically when you put an atomizer on.  For example when I put my .64 RTA on it automatically set wattage to 32w whereas I typically vape this atomizer at 50w.  32w is on the very low end but it will help newer vapers get into the adjust to taste range quicker.

The 510 on the Vmate is pretty deep and I haven’t had an atomizer yet that didn’t sit flush on the top.  The 510 is 24mm and the rounded atomizer area is 25mm.  Anything over that size will overhang a bit.

Pressing the fire button 5 times will turn off and on the mod.  Holding the forward adjustment button and the fire button will lock the mod.  Pressing the fire button 3 times will cycle through the TC modes.  Holding both adjustment buttons will enter the sub menu where you have wattage mode, memory/TCR mode, resistance lock, chip serial number, and firmware version.

**How it Vapes** -  This is my first experience with the Gene Chip in an adjustable mod.  I have to say it vapes well.  Fast firing mods have been my preference for a while and this one doesn’t disappoint.  For my preference, even given the lack of preheat, it’s on par with my favorite mods in wattage mode.  A big down fall to the fast firing here is that it fires every time the button is pressed; for example cycling through TC modes.  Temperature control works decently well but it is limited.  I don’t do TC with large high wattage coils, but I know a good portion of people do.  TC could be improved here by allowing a higher wattage rane and wattage adjustment.  Voopoo leaves the majority of TC settings to their chip.

The UForce T1 tank is a decent addition.  Mine came with a basic parallel coil setup.  The sliding top fill has come open for me in my pocket a couple times.  Due to the tapered top it doesn’t seem to open as easily as most top fill atomizers.  I love sliding top fill bt one of the downsides is that possibility of opening in your pocket.  The knurled portions make it really easy to adjust the airflow and take apart the atomizer.  Flavor on this atomizer was decent.  I wasn't blown away but it was acceptable.  I am coming off using 3 different atomizers with mesh coils and that probably plays a large part in my view point on the flavor here.  I found it took a little over a full tank to break in the coil for best flavor.  I put around 130ml of rough juice through this before the coil started tasting funny.  Using a lighter juice or juice with less sweetener will likely prolong coil life.  

---

**Pros**

* Light weight
* Fast firing
* Nicely designed and shaped
* Easily pocketable
* TC works well under 80w
* Simple menu system
* Bright screen
* Good 510
* Quality finish
* UForce T1 Tank is decent


**Cons**

* Plastic battery doors
* Fingerprint magnet
* TC tops out at 80w
* Mix ups of firing button and adjustment buttons
* Overhang from 25mm+ atomizers
* Adjustment moves too quickly during fast scroll

---

**Summary**

Overall I’ve enjoyed my time with the Vmate.  The Gene chip is worthy of its reputation for fast firing and good vaping.  The mod in the colorway I received looks classy, feels nice to hold, and is nicely portable.  I do wish the battery doors weren’t plastic and that there was easier tactile definition between the firing button and adjustment buttons.  I enjoy the simplicity of the menu system and bright and crisp screen.  The UForce tank is decent for flavor and styled nicely.  It may possibly open the top fill in your pocket.  I hope Voopoo puts more adjustment options for TC in the future.  I think this mod kit is a good setup to have around if you don’t want/need all the bright color screens and LEDs of most current mods.

t3_9sze05,Review: The Innokin Ares and MTL Vaping,"On October 19th, I received my new RTA… the Innokin Ares MTL RTA by Phil Busardo and Dimitris Agrafiotus (VapingGreek). I purchased it in order to experience MTL vaping… and somewhere along the line decided I would review it for y’all, as well, even though it’s a product that’s been out for a long time and has been reviewed by so many people already.

Because this is my first MTL tank, I’m going to review the Ares *and* MTL vaping. In terms of how the Ares works, I can only compare it to, say, the HugsVape Lotus, which is not an MTL tank, so that doesn’t seem to me to be a very fair comparison. So this is as much a breakdown of my first experience with MTL vaping as it is a review of the Ares.

#To Start…#

[Full Album](https://imgur.com/a/r5ZmW6b)

There are several reasons I wanted to try MTL vaping. I’ll get into the most important reason in the conclusion, but the short version is that I want more flavor with far less clouds… almost none, in fact. Of course, I’m off nicotine, and been for a while, so it’s more out of curiosity than anything else.

Immediately I realized I would have to completely adjust my expectations with vaping this. Because I’m vaping at much lower wattages, I expected it to be a cooler vape by definition. That… was not entirely true. I also expected the flavor to be different, and that *did* turn out to be true.
As for the airflow, it’s the exact opposite of what I’m used to. Keep in mind that I used, and *liked* (albeit barely), the Freemax Mesh Pro with the airflow *all the way open*. So that gives you a baseline for the kind of airflow I’ve always liked. To be honest, part of me didn’t expect to enjoy this airflow. That said, this atty has a *lot* of options for airflow… I almost wish there was a *good* DL RTA with this many airflow options (I know there *are* RTAs with so many airflow options, but the reviews on them… aren’t all great).

I should probably note here that I can’t really talk about throat hit. I don’t vape nicotine anymore. I vape simply because I enjoy it and I enjoy Boca Vape’s SN2. So… sadly… I can’t have any experience with MTL nicotine throat hits.

Also, I want to address something… I’m fully aware that my Think Vape Finder is a triple-18650 DNA250C device. I realize that’s a *powerful* mod for low-power MTL vaping. Here’s the thing… I don’t have a lower-powered mod; or any other mod that works, really. I can’t afford to purchase one either right now (although I have a job! Finally! It’s… it’s Godiva, which is not what I wanted, but… it’s a job!). Worse, after using temp control with a DNA, going back to a shitty proprietary board with, at best, so-so dry hit protection (like Wismec’s board), simply isn’t going to cut it (and I listen to DJLsb, P. Busardo, and Anthony Vapes for good temp control because they all do tech reviews with charts n’ science n’ shit). So my Finder is what I have to use with atties.

But come on… just think of the battery life I’m getting… seriously…

And finally… I had major issues with hitting temp protection. It wasn’t just occasionally, but all the damn time… sometimes it’d happen when the coil’s at room temperature, immediately after I hit the fire button (so no vaping at all just.. hit the fire button, and BOOM! Temp protection). At first, I thought it was the Ares, because I wasn’t hitting temp protection as often with my Lotus, Zeus Dual, or Mesh Pro. But then [somebody else posted here having similar issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/9s2vq6/dna_250c_temp_protect_issues/), and it made me wonder if it's a problem with the board...? And now that I’m using my Lotus again, I actually hit it once with the temp at 590˚F and the tank wicking perfectly. I hope there’s an update coming soon that fixes it *if* it’s really a problem with the board. It made enjoying the Ares really, really difficult because of how annoyingly often I hit it. So the coil reviews I provide are based around when I was able to actually vape them. (And before anyone says it, yes I *do* know what temp protection is, thanks.)

#The Coils#

##30-gauge SS316L wire, 11 wraps (counting legs), 2.5mm inner diameter, ~1.3 ohms##

https://imgur.com/iNEczXA

https://imgur.com/lZPdFLO

I started my settings at 400˚F and 15 watts. After having some trouble, I let the coil cool, rechecked the resistance, locked said resistance in, and moved to 430˚F and 20 watts.

So let’s get to my experience…

This coil had the most problems hitting temp protection. There was a stretch where I couldn’t vape it all. [So I posted here asking for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/9pw6zj/help_with_jumping_resistance_and_temp_protection/). For some reason I decided to blame the jumping resistance, which I should have known was actually normal for SS316L wire so why I chose to frame it like that I have no idea, but… base on a suggestion in that thread, I let the coil cool to room temperature, reread the resistance, locked it in, and started vaping at 430˚F and 20 watts.

Finally I was able to vape it some, and the way I got the best performance was by having the Ares either all the way open or simply using the larger (2mm diameter) hole. This is how the coil was kept coolest. And when it worked, the flavor was okay, and the experience was pleasant. Sadly, that’s all I can say because I didn’t stick with this coil very long.

As you can see, I went a rather… *different*… direction with this one. Maybe I’d have a little better luck this time…?

Honestly, I expected to have more trouble with this one in terms of how hot it’d get and whether or not the airflow options would be able to cool it well.

At first that was inaccurate, but then… temp protection… again. It wasn’t as bad as with the last coil but was still an issue.

I started it off at 430˚F and 20 watts with the Ares airflow all the way open (so all of the holes open). I expected it to be way too cool, with way too long of a ramp up time and an unsatisfying vape. But when I was able to vape it, I was pleasantly surprised by how decent it was, at least on the first impression. 

Yet again, though, I had to keep the airflow open in order for it to let me vape for some time before it hit temp protection.

As for the coil itself, I did have to twist the leads to fit them into the slots, but that’s easy enough and I never understood why that bothers people (especially reviewers) anyways. Are you really that pressed on building that slightly twisting your flatwire leads is *that* inconvenient? IDK… that just doesn’t seem annoying enough to me to be a con, so…

The flavor was… fine. Slightly better than the last coil, but I was slightly disappointed, honestly. It wasn’t terrible… The Zeus Dual honestly has more muted flavor than this. But it wasn’t as good as I thought it could be.

This was also a departure, in this case because it’s a different SS wire… 430 instead of 316L. It’s honestly probably not as surprising as it initially was to me, but the experience here was pretty similar to the quad-core clapton coil in terms of heat. I did jump around with the temperature and watts because… as I’m sure you can guess at this point… more temp protection.

I ended up vaping it at 500˚F and 30 watts, switching between the 2mm airflow hole and all the way open. Here is where I managed to avoid the temp protection issues for the most part. Flavor was actually good here in comparison with the other two coils. I’d been disappointed with the flavor so far, but then I tried this, and you know what? It’s not terrible. It’s definitely the best flavor I’ve had up to this point. My favorite of these first 3 (when I was able to vape it), it was a great coil and worked quite nicely. It gave me the best flavor and overall the best experience as far as it could. I still want to get an over-1-ohm experience with this right, but for now, this is probably my favorite build for the Ares.

I decided to go simple again, but this time with a slightly thicker wire than the first coil. Also… because I’m slow, and only realized it was an option when I put in this coil, I took out the airflow insert on the deck, just to see if it would work better. As you can imagine, this opened up the airflow and what I ended up having was more of a true DL vape (albeit restrictive at the 1mm, 1.2mm, and 1.6mm holes) than even a loose MTL vape.

I started, again, at 430˚F and 20 watts. So did I hit temp protection?

Yup. Yes I did. Only, this time, nowhere near as often. In fact, I was able to get some good use out of the 1mm, 1.2mm, and 1.6mm airflow holes this time. Which, let me tell you, was nice.

Thing is though, that at 430˚F and 20 watts, the flavor was pretty damn muted. So I left the watts the same but made my way up to 450˚F and opened the 1.2mm airflow hole. Flavor was still oddly muted, so I went to the 1.6mm airflow.

Why am I getting better flavor at the larger airflow holes? I thought it would work the opposite direction?

Anyways, I actually like this at 450˚F, 20 watts, and using the 1.6mm airflow hole. Okay flavor, not hitting temp protection too often… but, obviously, not very restrictive.

#Final Thoughts#

##MTL Vaping##
MTL vaping is very interesting. More restrictive on airflow, a very different experience on the inhale, and warmer than DL vaping. There’s less clouds, as well, which is nice (although I wouldn’t mind finding my way to something that’s all flavor and few to no clouds… especially for stealth vaping). I also very much appreciate not going through e-liquid so fast, and I rather enjoy the extended battery life.

That said, I don’t think I’m going to give up DL vaping for MTL vaping anytime soon. I do enjoy MTL vaping (despite my problems with the Ares itself). However, DL vaping is what I learned on, it’s what I know, and it’s my first love. I can’t sit here and pretend I don’t like clouds. I prefer flavor, of course; I’m not willing to sacrifice any amount of flavor for clouds. But I sometimes enjoy clouds, too. And I like the more open airflow. Honestly, the HugsVape Lotus is the best RTA I’ve owned so far. That could obviously change in the future, but right now, the Lotus is it.

But MTL vaping is not something I’m going to stop doing, either. The main reason I’m interested in MTL is because, as I said above in parentheses, I would very much like a vape with little to no clouds, but all of the flavor. I’m very interested in something I can take outside and use without anyone being wise to my use.

The only problem there, of course, is that I want temp control, or at least something like it… or, if not that, then some kind of *working* dry hit protection. The Lost Vape Orion looked interesting to me, but Phil Busardo himself had issues with flavor, it’s not the stealthiest considering the clouds it produces are pretty substantial for a pod device, and I’ve seen enough other people having problems with it (the tank portion flooding, things getting stuck, etc) that I’ve started second-guessing my desire for it.

It’s good that Evolv finally has a pod-based board (although what I really want from them is something like their boards for larger mods, but with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, and small enough to fit in pod-based devices… the “screen”, where you change wattage and temperature and access the menu system and all that, would be on your smartphone), but Lost Vape still has some work to do with the Orion. It’ll be interesting to see what other pod devices come out with the DNA Go board inside them, and what Evolv does with the board moving forward…

##The Innokin Ares MTL RTA##

I’ll say here that I used the restrictive drip tip more often than the wider one, but I did use both. I found the restrictive one more comfortable to use, but I liked both.
My first thought on trying this on the 1mm airflow hole (aside from the issues with the coil and temp protection) was *that’s is? That’s restrictive? I’ve smoked cigars with more restrictive draws than this*. That shocked me, and I decided to do some research as a result. Turns out, a lot of MTL vapers don’t consider the Ares to be a very restrictive MTL tank. In fact, I’ve seen some people call the 2mm hole a restrictive DL vape. Apparently, at least according to some MTL vapers, this tank, on the 1mm hole, is, at best, a loose MTL draw. And that has made me want to try other MTL tanks.

Does it get more restrictive than this on RTAs? What should I get? At least… what should I get that won’t cost over $100 and preferably isn’t a clone (although yes, I’m seriously considering getting a Kayfun clone because I want to try one of the Kayfuns but can’t currently afford the authentics; although that may change now that I *finally* have a job)?

But on the flipside, it may be a good thing that the Ares is so loose? Like I said… I had a lot of trouble with hitting temp protection way too often. But now I honestly don’t know if it was the Ares or the DNA250C. And that’s honestly even more frustrating.

One other thing about the airflow is the whistling. At 1mm, 1.2mm, and 1.6mm, this thing whistles. I’d really like to say that it isn’t annoying, and honestly, it wasn’t at first. In fact, I was straight up prepared to say the same thing I said about twisting flatwire leads a bit. *It’s just a whistle! Who cares about a little whistle? It’s not even that loud! Whistling isn’t a problem at all! Stop complaining about it.*

Thing is, though, that it matches the tone of my occasional tinnitus, which means that the whistling from the Ares would actually *trigger* my tinnitus. And that’s really frustrating. It also means that my rant above about the whistling not actually being annoying is… obviously… not true. It *is* annoying. Very annoying.

As for flavor… over all I’m honestly not impressed. This just isn’t enough for me flavor-wise. I may enjoy clouds, but I’m a flavor-chaser. It’s why I love the HugsVape Lotus so much… so far, I haven’t gotten better flavor out of any other RTA (I mean… the Mesh Pro is technically better, and y’all know I loved it, but I also prefer building my own coils, so I prefer RTAs). So for me personally, with RTAs, the Lotus set the bar. That doesn’t mean there aren’t better RTAs for flavor out there… I just haven’t tried them, yet
That said, it doesn’t quite seem fair to compare the Ares to the Lotus. The Ares is supposed to be an MTL RTA, while the Lotus is a DL RTA. But I would have thought that the less airflow and a more reduced chamber would have increased the flavor. I expected that an MTL RTA like the Ares would far surpass the Lotus just by design… 

Sadly, that’s not the case.

Now that’s not to say the flavor on the Ares is bad… far from it. It’s pretty decent, especially with some builds over others. But overall, especially for an atty designed by Phil Busardo and Dimitri Agrafiotis working with Innokin, I expected better.

(And obviously I’m an RTA person. Once I can afford to get a squonker, I’ll start using RDAs again, but for now, it’s RTAs all the way.)

It’s super simple to build on. I did notice that some people had trouble capturing thinner leads, but I never had this problem. I loved being able to just drop the leads in. Twisting the leads of my quad-core fused clapton was perfectly easy to do, as well, so that wasn’t an inconvenience for me.

**Pros**

-Easy build deck

-A lot of nice extras

-Comfortable drip tips, especially the more restrictive one

**Cons**

-Flavor could be better

-Apparently not as restrictive as MTL-style vaping can (or should?) be

-Airflow whistling was indeed annoying… and triggered my tinnitus

#Conclusion#

Overall, I’ll say this... I’m definitely interested in continuing my MTL journey. And, at the moment, I’ll *probably* keep the Ares in my rotation for when I want less clouds and a stealthier vape. But I have to believe that there are better MTL RTAs out there that just do a better job with it.

I mean look… it’s not a terrible introduction to MTL vaping. That should be obvious as it did help to make me more interested in MTL vaping. It’s so easy to build on, and if you’re lucky (that is, you don’t have my problems with it), this could be a great way to transition from DL vaping to MTL vaping, considering how loose it apparently is. But I expected an MTL RTA designed by Phil Busardo to be a lot better than this. I hope he plans on going back to the drawing board and trying again, because I feel like he should be capable of coming up with something a lot better.

(You know, it occurs to me that a lot of the problems I had with this RTA might be because the issues I was having with temp protection. So I might actually revisit the Ares if/when Evolv fixes the issue [assuming it is indeed an issue] to see if my mind has changed on it... and I'll update y'all, too, if I end up doing that...)

And that’s it! My third review. Hope you enjoyed it, and I hope the formatting made this more readable this time. Now that I have a job, I’ll have a tiny bit more income to actually purchase more stuff to review! So maybe I’ll do more of these, after all. We’ll see… (I do want to try YiHi and Dicodes, honestly… so… time to start working saving for them into my budget…)",Wed Oct 31 07:45:06 PDT 2018,NateHevens

t3_9syvms,Does anyone know if nicotine itself is bad for people with Osteoporosis (low bone density) and inflammatory arthritis?,"Hey all! So I'm 26 and was diagnosed with osteoporosis about four years ago, roughly the same time that I quit the ciggies and got an e-cig; not because of the Osteoporosis but just because I tried a vape and decided straight away that I was gonna swap my bad habit for a much healthier alternative.

Just 2 months ago I was also diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis in pretty much all of my joints. I'm not sure what type yet as Australia's public health system is ass and I've gotta wait another 2 months still to see a rheumatologist, I'm quite lucky that I had already been on the waiting list all year before I got the scan results showing inflammatory arthritis.

Anyway, I'll get to the point - smoking is 100% horrible for every person but even more so for anyone with either of these chronic conditions, yet alone people that are lucky enough to have both like myself 😑😑😑 

I have asked my GP and **three** seperate specialists whether nicotine itself has got anything to do with the harm that smoking can cause to worsen these conditions or if just nicotine is fine. Every single one of them said something along the lines of ""I have no idea but **smoking** anything is bad for your body"". One even told me that I'm stupid if I think **burning** and inhaling anything is anything but extremely unhealthy... I think it's safe to say that these medical professionals were hopeless and I didn't get a real answer. I'm not saying vaping isn't bad for you, I don't know if it is or isn't, but I want to know about the risks specifically when it comes to Osteoporosis and Arthritis.

Whew, sorry that was longer than I anticipated. Anyway, if someone that reads this has even the slightest bit of info to do with vaping/nicotine, osteoporosis/bone density and arthritis that would be incredible since I can't find any info on vaping, only smoking cigarettes.

t3_9sysa3,Apothecary Elixir Co. Current State & Updates!,"  

**Apothecary Elixir Co. Current State of Affairs**

Hi everyone! This is going to be a long read, but hopefully this will explain some of our recent issues and explain how we plan to address them going forward.

First and foremost, our communication and fulfillment time over I’d say the last 2 months has been pretty horrible, partially due to some backend issues, partially due to a USPS office that apparently absolutely hates me, and partially on our own end. This is absolutely a departure from a lot of the things AECo. was built on and something that (at least the portions that are within control) will be addressed going forward.

**Backend/Technical Issues**

Over the last 2 months, we’ve had a pretty large conglomerate of uncontrollable backend issues that have been out of our control. These include our contact page getting spammed to the point where we can’t even tell who’s trying to contact us at times, API issues between our shipping software and the WebAPI of the storefront causing orders not to show in the fulfillment queue, essentially making them invisible to us and getting marked as fulfilled even though they’ve not actually been shipped, and payment processor issues. The payment processor issues are something that occurred for about 3 days and is the first time in our history that’s occurred, and hasn’t brought its head back up again. The spam issues are ongoing and we’re implementing some additional captcha on the contact form soon to \*\*hopefully\*\* resolve that issue. The API issues between our shipping software have been resolved for about a month now and we haven’t seen them creep back up yet, thankfully. So from a TECHNICAL side, our contact form issues are about the only thing that **should** remain an issue and I’m hoping to have it resolved within the next 2 weeks. 

**Shipping/USPS issues**

This one is really the bane of my existence and something that I’m continuing to fight. The local PO here has a really bad habit of not scanning items when they pick up the daily shipment, which ultimately results in items sitting in “Label Created” status for days which is annoying as fuck. It’s something that I’ve had conversations with the local postmaster about, conversations with our “normal” pickup person regarding, and something I continue to beat my head against a wall regarding. While we were doing our restock last week I made some changes to our shipping side of things to start generating a batch scan form – something I’d avoided doing for a long time because I personally prefer each item to be scanned, not a batch form that marks everything I “say” was shipped as shipped because it has potential for discrepancies..that being said, it’s hard for it to be worse than it is right now so why not try it out at least eh? We’ll see how that goes moving forward.

**Randy Issues**

Here’s where I get a bit of a well deserved beatup. For the last couple of months, I’ve not been on top of AECo. things as much as I probably should have – which when you compound them with some of the technical issues that we’ve had just results in a clusterfuck. There are a number of reasons for this, partially that my ACTUAL career (you guys know that I’m a software architect? That as much fun as it could be, that AECo. isn’t a primary career for me? Well you do now!) has been super busy as of late and I haven’t been able to spend as much time on AECo. as I probably would have liked. The ECR drama that occurred here recently pretty much put me on hiatus from reddit for a while, so PMs/etc weren't getting answered like they should have. I don’t like drama, I won’t be involved in it, and I won’t associate AECo with it either. This isn’t a knock on anyone, I get that drama happens, I’m just not going to be part of it. It doesn’t end well when you have friends on both sides and the only thing you have to say is “you’re all acting like 3 year olds,” so I just remove myself from the situation. I hope that ECR is in a better place now though. 

A conglomeration of things got us off track a bit, but we’re in the midst of righting the ship. None of this is anything close to an excuse, just an explanation of where we got off course. We should absolutely be doing better. We just got in our supply order that we were waiting on and should have all orders that are waiting to ship out the door by tomorrow morning at the very latest and be current with everything. We’re going to spend the next couple of weeks getting a bunch of backstock replenished and be ready to go for black Friday and the rest of the holidays, but we’ll be back to business as normal real soon.

At the end of the day, we’re dedicated to getting back to the fulfillment/response times that we were at before. We’re taking steps to fix the technical issues and such, and I’m committed to squaring away the communication issues as well. 

As always, thank you guys for always being so awesome, and I'm sorry we haven't quite been where we should be lately, but we'll get back to it.

&#x200B;

Happy Halloweeeeeen!

t3_9syqkg,"Dvarw DL RTA - Quick Review, this thing surprised me","Why Did I Buy This?

Because it was $11.82 on fasttech


How Does It Look?

Click the link above. If you've been vaping long enough to remember the classic Kayfuns (3.1 and earlier), this has a very similar style. Simple and stylish, with no crappy design attempts to make it stand out. You can also grab full metal body's on FT, if the polycarb tank isn't your style.

What's it like to build?

This is what surprised me about this atty. Haven't touched an RTA in a while. I've owned well over a dozen and, other than the Doggystyle, they've all been a bit of a fuck around. Once I got into squonking, RTA's seemed pointless. This atty coiled and wicked effortlessly from the first go. The posts are old school, wrap the wire around the screw then tighten. I fit 24g SS with no issues, but wouldn't push anything thicker than that. I'm using a 3mm 10wrap coil but you can easily fit 4mm coils in there. Heaps of cotton, make sure you fill out all the inside space away from the coil, but don't let the cotton pop out.

How does she wick?

Due to the design, absolutely effortlessly. The wick holes are larger than a mesh coil for a sub ohm tank. As it requires a thick amount of cotton, I'd recommend slightly spaced builds as they wick easilier (but still, wick hard). 80GV and no dry hits with chain vaping.

What's the flavor like?

Just got the thing today and so far I've vaped about 10ml of a juice I have absolutely no interest in. The only redeeming quality of this juice is the price I paid for it ($0). Out of this tank, this is delicious regardless and I am thoroughly enjoying the sheer quality of this fantastic vape. The flavor and density reminds me of the Kayfun 5 (except that wicking isn't a crapshoot). At 40W I can't ask for a single thing more out of this atty. In a world of short/condenced everything, there's something special that a taller, condensed chamber does to flavor.

Anything Else?

Those metal airflow inserts. Sit right under the coil. Airflow Rings are damn lies, and this is the only real way you'll get an ""authentic"" change of airflow on a non RDA tank (according to opinionated long time vapers like myself). The Skyfall and co's implementation can suck it, because thick pieces of plastic shouldn't be near a hot coil (absolutely hate when any company does this). Sure, you can't change the airflow without removing the coil. But this atty is for vapers who already know how they like to vape, and I don't see any reason to ever change the airflow insert. The tightness is just spot on.

Cons?

I'm definitely going to have to save and buy the authentic now. The designers definitely deserve my blood and money. Also top fill would be sweet, but the atty holds 6ml so it's no great hardship to bottom fill.",Wed Oct 31 06:30:35 PDT 2018,roidie

EDIT : thanks everyone for the input, I took someone's advice and called up a b&m store near me and they carry the coils I needed ( at a higher pric, but fuck you Marlboro). I'll be careful in ordering coils earlier from now on. Thanks for a the info guys, you are the best. ",Tue Oct 30 01:41:26 PDT 2018,astronautduke
t3_9sxpls,Has anyone switched from DTL to MTL?,"Hi,

I am considering dropping all of my sub-ohm DTL year and switching solely to MTL pod systems. Firstly, I will burn through less juice. Secondly, and I am not scientist, but I figure that as MTL burns through less juice, it could be better for my lungs? Please correct me if I am wrong. Thirdly, I just prefer an MTL hit. Has anyone made the switch? I mean completely made the switch by selling all of their DTL/sub-ohm/RDA gear etc.

t3_9sxm0x,Leakage through Battery Door,"Hi,

I'm considering to buy Geekvape Nova or Vaporesso Revenger X and both of them have magnetic door over battery. I've got a concern about liquid might reach to batteries more easily on mods with side doors. 

Also as for Nova specifically, it doesn't have ventilation for batteries. I'm not sure it's highly matter but most of the mods do have on their case. 

I didn't see any examples about my points but opinions would be appreciated.

Thanks.",Wed Oct 31 03:52:41 PDT 2018,prustr

t3_9sx8yj,Kaees aladdin RDA review,"This is a short-term review on the [**KAEES ALADDIN RDA**](https://kaees.com)	


**Disclaimer**
I purchased this product myself. This review is not at the request of the manufacturer or supplier.


**Images**

[These images]( https://imgur.com/a/g9VwZ1t) were taken by me.


**What is it?**
A 24mm single coil, triple airflow RDA

**How much does it cost**

* About $8 from a local B&M! 


**What do you get?**	

* KAEES Aladdin RDA
* 1 x 0.25 ni80 triple core clapton coil (with specs given in the packaging)
* Hex driver
* The usual o-rings, etc

The packaging is pretty good quality. Nice box, foam inserts etc. Nothing special to make you think “wow!” but nothing terrible.
There was a security code which I verified as legitimate on the Kaees website.

**Why am I reviewing such an old RDA?**

Mainly because I haven’t noticed a review of this RDA on this sub and it’s an interesting design.


**What’s it like?**	
Firstly, the important thing for me is to get this RDA in silver. The logo on the black and rainbow versions is far too prominent, on the silver it’s barely noticeable.

The RDA is made of 304 stainless steel and all the machining is really well done, I was quite impressed with this. However, the peek insulator which forms one of the side airflow intakes isn’t fitted well, it’s at a noticeable angle – I have no idea if this affects the airflow performance, but the lack of alignment doesn’t match the good quality machining, trying to adjust this has so far proven to be unsuccessful.

Another issue I had was that when I first opened the box, most internal parts of the RDA were covered in oil, it certainly needed a very good clean before use.

The 510 pin has a removable hex screw that converts it into a squonk pin – earlier versions had two separate 510 pins.

Building on this RDA is very easy, it has the now very common single coil post setup – but it’s lacking a notch to center the coil, wicking is very easy.

The juice well is deep (6mm, I think) and despite being bottom air-flow, I only experienced one leak from over dripping.

The drip-tip **looks** like an 810, but is actually a 510 – the top-cap airflow design uses the space required for an 810.

Tolerances were all good, the o-rings are nice and airflow adjustment is easy, there is a lock on the cap so it doesn’t just spin.


**How does it perform?**

I’ve tried **a lot** of builds and coil positions in this RDA, the best performance so far has been with the supplied coil and with fused claptons. It doesn’t really work well with the regular high ohm builds that I prefer for single coil RDAs.

The triple airflow is interesting because it really does give the RDA a lot of versatility, without having to change the coil, however it isn’t excellent at any one thing – I think that’s the main problem with this RDA, it’s trying to be too versatile, when if it had been dual airflow it might have been better.

The top and middle airflow are adjustable, while the bottom airflow is non-adjustable.

With all three airflows open, I found that it lacked flavor with my builds and with bottom airflow only, it was too restrictive for something this size. I found that bottom+top gave more emphasis to flavor, while bottom+middle gave more emphasis to vapor production – the vapor production was very impressive for a single coil RDA.

The cap doesn’t get hot, I had no issues when running it at 75w – although I found 65w to be the sweet spot for this RDA with the included coil.

Overall, if you want clouds from a single coil RDA that doesn’t get hot – this is a good choice. If you want flavor from a single coil RDA, there are many more suitable options, mostly being low profile 22mm. If you only have one or two RDAs, this is a good choice because it gives you options, if you have a large collection, you probably already have RDAs that perform their specific function better than a multi-purpose RDA like this.

I feel this would have been better with just two airflow options – sure the selling point of triple airflow is interesting, but either removing the middle airflow, making it a little more low profile to focus more on flavor, or removing the top airflow (which would allow you to use an 810 drip-tip) and focusing on vapor production would have resulted in a better performing RDA.



**What could be improved?**

* Send it out clean.
* Install the peek insulator aligned correctly.
* Stick to two airflows. 
* Put a notch for coil alignment. 

**Pros**

* Excellent machining.
* Included coil is good with all specifications given in the packaging.
* Versatile.
* Doesn’t heat up. 
* Deep juice well.
* Mine was very cheap!

**Cons**

* Flavor isn’t as good as other single coil RDAs
* Held back by inability to use 810 drip-tips
* The miss-aligned peek insulator annoys me


**Conclusion**	

**Who should buy this?**

* Someone who can find it for $8!
* Someone who wants a versatile RDA 

**Who should not buy this?**

* Someone who has a collection of RDAs and chooses each one for a particular purpose.

**Will I use this?**

* Of course, I will. It won’t be my daily choice, but it’s easy enough to build on that I can experiment with different coils in search in increased performance.

**Final thoughts**

My quest to find the ultimate single coil RDA that combines the flavor of a compact 22mm with the vapor production of a 24mm still continues. I have the feeling that [this]( https://cthulhumod.com/mjolnir-rda-unique-double-chamber-system/) may be the answer.

t3_9sx58c,Dovpo firmware update bricked my mod,"Got my Topside 2 days ago.  Love it but wanted to try TC. I  followed all the instructions but when updating it gave me a popup error ""Update APROM failed"". Now my device won't turn on under any circumstance.  Trying to update it back to the non-TC gives me the same error.

Does anyone have a solution?

Topside is now a brick (small brick, though :-)

Edit: solved it by doing the following (not all steps might be needed but I'm putting in exactly what I did)

1. Rebooted my PC

2. Used the blue USB cable which came with the Dovpo Topside box (it's a flat cable and is shorter than a 'normal' cable)

3. Plugged it into my USB3 (not USB2) socket

4. PC gave me a message about detecting a PWM device and it installed some drivers

5. First attempt at an update failed as I let go of the + button before the update program could start

6. 2nd attempt was a success.

I'm now using TC mode, seems to be working fine.  It was a pain updating it, though.  And holding the + & - buttons down while inserting the USB plug is also a pain.  But I'm a happy camper now.",Wed Oct 31 02:27:08 PDT 2018,jobics

t3_9swztt,Just had a dream about vaping,So I took some melatonin and was sitting in a chair and all of a sudden I was asleep. Dreamt I went to check my charger and it was flashing some warning. So I'm looking at my battery and it starts smoking. (I've never experienced a battery venting so it was like my dream interpretation). I run outside and put it inside something and it pretty much blows the container apart in the least violent way possible. So then I go back inside and try my other set of batteries in my mod and the core of the batteries start melting in my hands. Eventually I wake up but the dream was so realistic I thought it was real for a few minutes. Checked my vape and felt so relieved lol. Man that was fucking trippy and weird as hell. Not sure if it was just random or I've got some subconscious fear of my batteries but I've never had a dream like that lol.

t3_9swza2,Nic salt and sub-ohm?,"Hello,  

I'm struggling to quit smoking cigarettes as I always goes back to the analogs quickly. I've tried a couple of vapes (Smok H-Priv, Bo One, Smok Brit Mini and currently a Vaporesso Cascade One) and keep trying buying new ones in the hope that *this* will be the one. They never are unfortunately.  

I was thinking that maybe it's not the vapes that are the problem, perhaps it's the nicotine? I *think* that the reason for me going back to cigarettes might be because of the instant ""satisfaction"" from a cigarette, while it takes a long time (in comparison) from vaping.  

I read that nicotine salts is more like the nicotine in cigarettes (in terms of how fast my body absorbs it) and thought that this might help me get rid of the cigarettes - maybe.  

However, I don't quite understand how to mix salts compared to freebase nicotine, they seem to be different in mg/ml? Or perhaps I'm just misinterpreting it.  

I also read some place that it's not recommended to use nicotine salts with sub-ohm devices? Is this true and why?  

I'm currently vaping 3mg with the Vaporesso Cascade One as 6mg burns my throat.  

I live in Sweden and nic salts isn't especially available here. The only one I've found is called Sage and is 18mg in a 10ml bottle. Should I just mix this with 50ml as usual to get 3mg juice or are nic salts mixed differently?

**LUX**

The Wellon LUX is an ultra-portable pod system with very similar stylings to the crazy popular JUUL device. The device itself is comprised mainly of the battery with pods you can insert into the top. This is all pretty standard stuff for a pod-based system. There's nothing really revolutionary here, although, the LUX incorporates a few nice design features. Being that this is a pod system, and given it's simplicity, there's not really much to say, so let's jump right into it.

**Device:** The main portion of the LUX is the battery portion, which houses a 450mAh rechargeable battery. Pods are inserted into the top of the device and connects to contact points inside the housing. In the center of the housing is a small hole that feeds the airflow from the bottom of the device, through the pod. There are also two slits, one on either side of the device, towards the top that help to seat the pod and allow you to see your juice level.

The LUX is a draw-activated device, so there are no buttons to press, which helps it maintain its sleek appearance. Towards the bottom of the device is a cutout of the word ""LUX"" which houses an LED indicator: Green=60-100%; Blue=20-60%; White=0-20%; Red=Completely drained. When first inserting a pod, the LED flashes for 2 seconds indicating the pod has been detected and is ready to use. Charging the LUX from empty is a fairly quick affair, taking only about 2 hours to do.

---

**Pods:** The LUX pods have a resistance of 1.4ohm, hold 1.2mL of eliquid and have a ceramic heating element. The pod comes in two pieces: the main body of the pod and the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece acts as a cover for the pod and closes off the fill ports. There are two small fill ports on the top of the pod and really require a needle-tipped bottle to fill. Having the two ports is a good idea as it allows air to escape while filling and helps prevent bubbles from forming and preventing you to fill the pod. Also, on either side of the device is a small piece that sticks out and sits into the groves on the top of the battery. This allows you to easily see your juice level, which is definitely a plus. The draw on the pods is a a bit of a loose MTL draw and can be hit as a restricted DTL. 

---

**Performance:** The main things I concern myself with when it comes to pod systems are battery life, draw consistency, coil flavor, coil longevity, looks, and time to charge. Battery life on the LUX is pretty good. Lasting me several days of intermittent use. I mainly use pod systems as stealth vapes while in my cubicle, so they don't really see much constant action, but lasting several days is definitely a plus. The LUX also charges fairly quickly. It's not too much of a concern for me primarily using these devices at my work desk as I also have a way to charge it. The LED indicator is nice so you can be sure to charge it up before you hit the road to ensure you have enough battery life. The look and styling of the LUX is also quite nice as it's not gaudy and looks professional. I'd rather be vaping on something that looks like the LUX while in my cube as apposed to something that's got clowns or some crazy wrap on it.

Coils seemed to last an okay amount of time. I was able to refill the pods a few times before I felt I needed to change them. However, at about $5 a pod I should be able to get 5 plus fills easily out of them. This was not the case. Flavor for the pods started pretty good. I was very surprised at how decent the flavor was. Again, that too faded too quickly and feel like for the price it should last a lot longer than it does. The draw on the LUX was a bit inconsistent. For a draw activated device this is one thing that needs to be right. However, the device occasionally dropped power while I was taking a drag. This was more of an issue while using an MTL approach. I did not have this issue while taking DTL hits. Regardless, these pods systems are mainly MTL devices and should hit consistently as such.

---

---

**Final Thoughts**

**Pros**

* Ultra portable
* Professional style
* Can see juice level without removing pod
* LED indicator
* Charges quickly
* Battery life
* Initial flavor

**Cons**

* Requires needle-tipped bottle to fill
* For the price, the pods should last longer
* Flavor fell off sharply
* Inconsistent draw
* Pods are expensive

&nbsp;

I really think this device could be so much better than it currently stands. They got some things right, however, it falls short in all the places that really matter. This was the case with the Ripple, and Wellon has followed suit with the LUX. I think if they work on their pods a bit more this could be a real competitor in the pod marketplace.

**Purchasing**

* Heavengifts - $24.95

*Pod prices are $20 for 4*

**About**

I say this is an Average Vaper Review because I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who has been vaping for a while (8 years), but doesn't get too in-depth with the technical aspects of the products. I'm evaluating these products as to how well they work out the box, their ease of use, and whether or not they hold up over the course of use. I don't have the skill set to produce thorough testings of the electronics and I defer that to those better suited. This review is purely my experience using the items I received.

t3_9sutfw,Eightvape shipping guarantee is BS! Also anywhere have the naboo kit in black in stock?,"Okay, I know eightvape has a less than stellar reputation here and I should have known better. I just really wanted the naboo kit in black and they were the only ones that had it. So I ordered it on the 22nd, paid for the ""shipping guarantee"" and FedEx 2 day shipping. To be fair they actually processed my order and shipped it the next day. 
 
Unfortunately, and the reason I paid extra for the ""shipping guarantee"" is because I live right next to the high school. For those unfamiliar with the typical high schooler, the majority of them are generally untrustworthy douche canoe's and a package with the word vape on it is like crack to these little bastards. 
 
Anyway, veering back on topic. I let them know and their reply, 3 days later, was ""sorry, you'll have to contact FedEx and file a claim yourself"". Gee thanks, so I paid extra for what now? Really, the shipping guarantee explicitly stated they will deal with any damaged/missing or lost packages so you don't have to. Now I have to go down to FedEx on Halloween and file a claim that's going to take forever to process. And try and find somewhere that has the black naboo in stock.


  TLDR: Eightvape Offers a paid addon service to deal with missing/damaged or stolen packages but don't honor it if something happens.

t3_9su5em,Review: Voopoo Drag 2 - I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.,"**I'm not mad.  I'm just disappointed.**

I'm no professional reviewer by any means.  So, let's get that out in the open first thing.  If you're expecting the typical ""youtube reviewer"" that's going to tell you how wonderful and amazing this product is and that everything negative about it is just ""subjective"" anyway...just like the last 57 devices they reviewed, you're going to be disappointed...like I am with this new Drag 2 from Voopoo.

Oh man, Voopoo is never going to send me anything else to test...ever again.  I'm sure.  I'm sorry Voopoo.  The truth must be told.  There are far too many professional YouTube ""reviewers"" that are just blowing smoke (yes...that pun is intended).  By the way, on a side note, if you have an entire channel of positive reviews, and I can't ever find you really saying anything negative about anything...are you really reviewing shit or just advertising?  I mean, come on.  Anyway, back to the topic at hand.

Now, we're talking about the new Voopoo Drag 2.  If you want the official specs on it, and what all is in the box (it's basically the same typical stuff that comes in every kit these days), go to Voopoos website.  Seriously, don't make me copy and paste off their website.  Go get your info from the source:

[http://en.voopootech.com/drag-2-kit](http://en.voopootech.com/drag-2-kit)

Voopoo decided to give out some units to people via social media so that they could test them out and review them.  Somehow, they decided to choose me as one of the testers and sent me a random Drag 2 in the mail.  So, I guess this is where I'm supposed to give you the canned ""Disclaimer: This product was sent to me for the purposes of review, but trust me, I'm totally not going to let the fact that this company sent me free shit sway the opinion I give you of this product.""  Also, on a side note, color me impressed with DHL getting this thing from China to my doorstep in the States in 3 business days.  Props to you DHL.  My package looks like your workers had an impromptu game of soccer with my package as the ball, but you got it here in quick time.

Speaking of colors and being impressed, mine came in the ""Scarlet"" resin, as Voopoo calls it.  Most of the photos I've seen of this color were not very impressive to me, honestly.  Most photos I've seen seemed to have too much white and gray in it.  But, I was pleasantly surprised with the way this one turned out.  Plenty of red and black.  I like it.  It's not the Island color that I was hoping for (have you seen pictures of that one?  No?  Google it.  It looks awesome in some of the pictures I've seen of it), but I still like it.  I mean...it was free.  I'm not going to complain about free shit.  Actually...yes.  I am going to complain about free shit.  Call me an asshole if you want.

**Appearance:**

We've all come to know and love (or hate...maybe you are sick of seeing them?) the original Drag.  A classic look with stylish resin panels that doesn't look like it should have a NOS sticker on the side (I'm looking at you Smok).  It does still have that ""DRAG"" logo on the battery door that EVERYONE complained about.  ""Please just put that awesome resin on both panels, Voopoo!"" everyone cried.  Voopoo was all like, ""We got you fam!  LOL"" and just put the same DRAG logo on the panel door.

But, at least they rounded the edges this time around.  That seemed to be a common complaint as well with the original Drag, so this time around they rounded the edges to make it feel a bit better in the hand.  Yay for ergonomics.  It works.  It does feel more comfy in the hand.

I'm not sure it was a common complaint with the first one that the 510 connector wasn't centered, but what was a common complaint was that any atomizer over 24mm would overhang the mod.  Hell, even 24mm would almost appear to overhang because of that little lip on the original.  Well, they decided to fix the overhang complaint this time around....not by making the mod thicker....but by moving it towards the center where it's wider due to the rounding of the mod.  This means it can now utilize 26mm without overhang.  However, notice I said ""towards the center"" instead of centered.  It's not centered.  It's not at the far edge...nor is it centered.  It's like...almost centered.  But...it's not.  What the hell?  Voopoo...why is the 510 OFF-center?  I don't understand this at all.  It's merely a visual thing, but it just...looks odd.  It makes me think that at some point along the way when somebody was mocking this thing up in some CAD software they screwed up a measurement somewhere, and the 510 connector ended up a few millimeters off center, and by the time someone noticed it was too late.  ""Ah...we've already spun up the machining...it'll be fine.  Just go with it.""  One thing I’ll note here is that I’m used to taking my top-cap off of my RDA and placing it on the side of the top of my Drag while I drip onto my coils.  I can’t do that with this one due to their being no shelf.  That may not be a concern for most.  But...it’s a con for me personally, (uh oh!  There’s that “subjective” thing again!).

Speaking of the 510 connector.  Yes, it's raised.  It's kind of noticeable, but it's not a huge deal for me personally (hey, here comes that term ""subjective"" again!).  Voopoo has said they decided to raise it a bit to prevent atomizers from scratching the top of the mod.  I find this hilarious, because on my original Drag that's had atomizers taken on and off hundreds of times the top of the mod is the only place where paint isn't scratched off.

OH!  The paint.  So I saw where Voopoo has said the paint on this one should be more durable.  Time will tell, but I think I'm going to have to call bullshit.  It may be more durable, but it's still not durable.  For the week I've had this thing, I've actually been very cautious in trying not to scratch it and making a point not to put it in my pocket with any keys, change, etc.  I know, I probably should have tested out just how durable the paint was.  So, the other day I was getting some groceries out of the car and thought, fuck it.  I'll lock it, shove it in my pocket while I walk from the garage into the house.  If it scratches that easily...it scratched that easily.  I locked the mod and slipped it into my pocket that happened to have my keys in it.  I then walked about 20 feet into my kitchen where I sat my groceries down and pulled it back out of my pocket.  The first thing I noticed was a chip of paint missing just below the USB port.  Color me impressed with the Drags ability to accumulate war scars anyway.

**Moving on to Function:**

It vapes.  No, seriously, it's a box mod.  It holds two 18650 batteries, has a nice chipset that fires them fast, and looks and feels pretty good.  Speaking of batteries, though.  Voopoo seems to have tightened up the space where the internals are so that they could make the overall box just a bit smaller than the original.  Honestly, I would have rather they just kept the outside size of the mod about the same and allowed enough room on the inside to fit 20700 batteries.  Why you no do this, Voopoo?

They even moved the screen out flush with the side instead of recessed like on the original.  This does have a cleaner look. They say this should prevent e-liquid from leaking under the screen?  I guess we'll see about that.  I'm not about to squirt all over this one to test that.  But, speaking of the screen.  I feel like Stevie Wonder when I'm outside in daylight, because I can't see the fucking screen to save my life.  It is WAY too dark.  Seriously.  It's stupid dark.  If you want to see the screen, you better find some shade...or wait until nightfall.

Also, I don't know if it's because of quality-control issues, and my screen just didn't get mounted properly, but when I look straight on at it, the right side is ever so slightly cut off.  I have to tip the mod to the right to see the far right edge of my screen.  The right side of the ""W"" is cut off.  Like, if I have it in wattage mode at 70 watts, I see ""70|/\\"" instead of ""70|/\\|""  Yeah, that's going to look stupid in text.  Just see the photo of the screen at the end of this post.

I need to also point out that my fire button rotates.  I don't know if that's by design or not.  The fire button on my original didn't spin.  But I can actually spin the fire button on this one.  Voopoo, if that's NOT by design, please let me know.  I'd like to know this thing isn't going to blow up on me.  The button does feel clickier than the original, though!  The buttons have a tad more travel than the original and do seem to feel better when being pressed.

Pressing the fire button actually fires this thing up super fast.  I think it fires faster than the original.  They've ""upgraded"" their Gene chip in this one, and I found that just clicking the button 5 times to turn it off causes it to fire 5 times really fast.  It's that fast.  But, one thing they've changed about this new Gene Fit chip is these ""FIT"" modes they call them.  Basically, they've added three pre-programmed modes where you don't choose any wattage, it just...does it for you.  They are supposed to be ""Battery Saver"" mode (FIT 1), ""Flavor Mode""  (FIT 2) and ""Cloud Mode"" (FIT 3).  And, when I put their new Uforce T2 tank on it, I notice the difference:  FIT 1 is low power, fit 2 seems to be higher power, and fit 3 seems to be the highest power.  At least, for me, that's what it seems like.  I've used the various FIT modes off and on, and that's the best I can conclude.  I primarily use RDAs these days, and I prefer to just set my own wattage, so I don't see myself using those.  I would hope that Voopoo would just let us program those modes ourselves (like the old ""memory modes"").  But, they do make a difference.  I've noticed several youtube reviewers claiming they couldn't tell a difference.  I do.

On that note, the new Uforce T2 tank is pretty nice for a sub-ohm tank.  The coils in this one don't actually suck like the ones that came with the T1.  These put out great flavor (I'm talking about the mesh coil, btw).  I didn't even try the U2 coil that was preinstalled.  I just straight threw in the mesh N3 coil.  Of course, that was after I assembled it.  Upon unboxing my kit, my N3 coil was in two pieces.  Nice QC Voopoo!

My only real complaint about the tank that comes with this kit is how fucking loud it is, though.  Like, if I'm being raped in a dark parking garage, all I have to do is get my hands on my Drag and take a quick drag on the Uforce T2 tank.  No need for a rape whistle when you have this tank on your mod.

Speaking of being raped.  We all know how solid the original Drag was in the hand.  If some dark figure stopped you in a dark alleyway and said ""Give me all your money!"" you knew you were fine if you had a Voopoo Drag in your pocket, because you had a literal brick to smash your muggers face in with.  This new Drag 2 is pretty solid in the hand, but due to it's weight and battery door, it just doesn't quite feel as solid as the original.  Mostly, due to the wobblecock battery door.

Seriously, this battery door slides side to side more than a fat strippers ass.  You see, on the original Drag the magnetic battery door sat inside a small lip around the battery compartment.  So it was flush with the rest of the mod.  That's not the case on the new Drag 2!

This new battery door simply attaches (via magnets) to the OUTSIDE of the battery compartment, and once again I'm pretty sure someone screwed up a measurement in the CAD software somewhere early on, and then after prototypes were made, some folks sat around a conference table, and some shoulders were shrugged accompanied by, ""It'll be fine.""  No, it's not fine, Voopoo.

The battery door is ever so slightly wider than the battery compartment where it snaps onto.  I don't have the tools available to accurately measure just how off it is, but it's very minor.  It's off just enough to make the door able to slide back and forth side to side, though.  This results in the door jiggling and twerking back and forth when in the hand.  I feel like I'm playing maracas when this thing is clicking back and forth in my hand as I'm using it.  Did you just google what maracas meant?  It's an instrument.  You shake it.  This Drag 2 doesn't sound quite like maracas, but you get the point.  When it's in the hand, the door clicks back and forth, and THAT is what makes it not feel solid in the hand.  It gives me the impression of cheapness, honestly.  Like, seriously, someone fucked up the measurement that the door panel was supposed to be cut at, and they rolled with it.  I was going to try to capture this with my camera, but due to some poor planning on my part I demonstrated this by recording a shitty video of this with my phone.  I’m sorry.  But you should get the picture of just how much play is in this door panel.

My wife has an iJoy Diamond with a similar design where the panel just snaps onto the outside of the mod, so I looked at it to see if it had a similar issue.  It does not.  But what I did notice, was that around where the door attaches, there is a very small lip around the battery compartment that holds it in place.  So, having said that, I guess I can't compare it at all.  My bad.  But regardless, the DAMN BATTERY DOOR DOESN'T JIGGLE BACK AND FORTH!  It’s hard to show in pictures.  I could show you the exact problem with why the door slides back in forth in person, but I found it hard to show in photos.  See the photo with my shitty yellow arrow, however, that points out where the battery door is just a cock-hair too wide allowing for side-to-side movement.

**Overall:**

Honestly, I know this sounds completely negative and as if I’m saying this is a horrible mod.  It really isn’t, though.  If they would fix the battery door, honestly it would be a pretty solid mod.  But with the door sliding back and forth every time you touch it, it just makes it feel cheap unlike the original that felt solid as a rock….errr brick.

Would I buy this?  I honestly still don’t know.  If the paint does hold up a bit better, I might would pick one up if I was in the market.  But still, I think if my OG drag dies, I’ll definitely try to find another one.  It’s just such a far more solid device, and I can actually see the damn screen out in daylight.  Sadly, I’m going to bet they will phase out the Drag and replace it with this one.  If that’s the case...perhaps I should go ahead and stow away another Drag.

On a scale of 1-10, personally (oh, here we go!  THIS IS SUBJECTIVE!) I think I would rate this mod a 5.5, and I would give the original a 7.5 (major points deduction for the shitty paint on the original).  The biggest cons for this mod is the floppy door and Stevie Wonder screen.  Now, bring on the downvotes and the mountain of shit I’m about to receive for this.

t3_9stz9z,Review - Voopoo Drag Mini,"So this is the new Drag Mini..

When I first saw the box I wasn't sure what was going to be inside. It only says Drag on the front of the box. It wasn't until I opened it up and pulled it out of the bag before I knew what I had. It is smaller than the original Drag but not by a whole lot. At first glance it is very similar  but there are some  nice changes. The corners are rounded  and one nice feature  is the  510 connector is  pretty much centered  on the top surface.  It is slightly wider in the center, so overhang is not as much of an issue as the og.

([https://imgur.com/Q235OlI](https://imgur.com/Q235OlI))

This one has a built-in battery with 4400 Mah capacity. It does put out up to 117 Watts, but the battery will drain pretty quick if you're up that high. I tried mine out with an RTA at about 80 Watts, and it seemed to drain pretty fast. Next I put on the included U Force tank with the pre-installed coil. This is a small coil that has a pretty tight draw, intended for use at low power. 

Note: both included coils are mesh type, so they should have a decent lifespan.

([https://imgur.com/HCGBgFl](https://imgur.com/HCGBgFl))

At 26 Watts it seems weak. 27 is not bad , at 28 Watts it starts to taste burnt. Very small window for optimal use. This coil is not my style. However the battery does last a long time at 27 Watts. Next I try the other included coil, rated for 50 to 80 Watts. This one works very well , produces plenty of vapor and the flavor is on point from the start. Running this coil about 60 watts , the internal battery lasts for about two tanks which is 10 mL. It will recharge pretty fast, like 1 ½ hours from dead to fully charged.

([https://imgur.com/maFOSkm](https://imgur.com/maFOSkm))

Now I've only had this kit for about a week so I haven't had a whole lot of time to play around with it. I'm not sure what the fit function is supposed to do , and I can't really find any information that explains it. I only use wattage mode on any of my setups, so I can't comment on temperature control. I haven't even gone into the menu on this yet. I turned it on and fired it up - and it works quite well. I love the form factor and this is so much more comfortable in the hand compared to the original Drag. One thing that does annoy me is that the 510 plate is raised up, so you will see a gap between the tank and the top of the mod. Usually it's not very noticeable but it is (in my opinion), the largest drawback of this kit. Overall I am quite happy , thank you Voopoo!

&#x200B;

So recently I dropped my Air into the sink (just the battery, not the pod), and I immediately pulled it apart and dried everything I could. Then, the air would hit intermittently, then stopped firing completely. I tried to clean that little circle the best that I could, but it was dead. So I quickly did some quick n dirty surgery on the poor fella. First I cut/ripped off the sensor, leaving the wires. Then I stripped the blue one, and connected it to one of the areas circled in the image below. This makes it work and charge again, but it fires whenever it's on. Just leaving this here in case anyone needs to revive their device after water damage / juice leaks.

&#x200B;

Breaking down the image, you want to take the blue wire and connect it to either one of the 3 circled spots. The one on the thick red wire represents the pad/wire for the small red wire going to the sensor.

&#x200B;

For me, this has been working great the past couple of days. I was able to solder the blue wire to the large blob (middle of the 3), and that provided a more permanent connection",Tue Oct 30 17:11:43 PDT 2018,Minebomber

t3_9sth3b,Customer experience with MYLÉ,"I wanted to drop a little ""customer experience"" review thread in here for the numerous people I see asking about Juul vs MYLÉ but from the perspective of dealing with them when I need support, as opposed to strictly reviewing the devices themselves.

**tl;dr I prefer my MYLÉ over my Juul, and I've had both of them for upwards of a year at this point. MYLÉ customer service was stellar comparatively and my experience with the device has been above that of my Juul for the better part of a year now, sans some QC (quality control) concerns.**

The Juul excels at brick and mortar availability here in my state (USA); I assume the same goes for a lot of other people as well. If you're someone who wants to be able to stop in a gas station and pick up some replacement pods, this is going to be much inherently easier than MYLÉ for a lot of people. Vape shops tend to carry pods for both in a lot of places, but no local vape shop as started carrying MYLÉ pods for me.

Secondly, it's smaller. This comes with the objectively negative side effect of having less battery and smaller pods with less overall juice, but if the size matters more than anything, Juul might win out in favor for you. The charging methodology is preferable as well, in my opinion, as they've patented the magnetic USB adapter that the MYLÉ devices also used to have. This adapter is no longer the charging method for MYLÉ, as the recent lawsuits have them switching new devices to micro USB (which is kind of a plus in a way as micro USB cords are prevalent and it's one less thing you might have to carry around if you're already using micro USB cables for other devices you own.)

MYLÉ wins for me strictly based on the battery life and pod size. It holds nearly twice as much juice and lasts about twice as long for me. This was the deal breaker for getting rid of my Juul. I can vape longer in both aspects with a minimal increase in size.

\---

But, what I really wanted to point out was the customer experience I've had with MYLÉ recently, compared to my Juul in the past.

When I purchased my Juul from a third-party (gas station) a long time ago, the circuit board inside stopped responding about 3 months into me owning it. I wasn't able to get a replacement from them, presumably because of it being purchased at a gas station. They couldn't really justify why that was the case, and their warranty never stated anything like that at the time, but I still bought a replacement Juul and went on my merry way for the next several months before that one died and I ended up ditching them for MYLÉ.

My MYLÉ that I purchased (also third-party, from online retailer [eCiggity.com](https://eCiggity.com)) lasted about 8 months before having similar issues to my Juul. I was completely oblivious to even trying to warranty it at the time. I purchased a new one. But, just a month into using it, the same issues reoccurred. Furthermore, it didn't seem to ""detect"" my pods unless I pressed them down hard against the connectors. I wasn't about to purchase a third one. I was concerned about their QC at this point. However, they honored their warranty and although I understandably had to pay for a label to ship it back to them, they promptly shipped me a new one. But much to my dismay, when it arrived, the new one also did not work. Didn't respond to charging, didn't respond to draws--nothing. This was the newer micro USB model, too. I thought maybe they sacrificed even more QC with these new models, but I wasn't reluctant to reach out to them about it this time either.

I'm here today with another new MYLÉ, also a micro USB model, puffing away without incident for the past week or so. QC concerns have faded for me again (but still in the back of my mind) and I'm continuing to enjoy what I view as a much better device, with much better customer service behind it. Time will tell again if the device will last, but honestly, the experience is so much more enjoyable over time than the Juul had been, I wouldn't hesitate to replace it with another one.",Tue Oct 30 16:49:03 PDT 2018,cerulliulliulli

t3_9ste4n,VooPoo Mini Review,"So I decided to write a review of the Voopoo Mini, considering a limited amount of people have it and the majority who do are youtubers, giveaway winners, or shop owners. Many of the opinions on said device can be rushed in the sense that they were in a hurry to be the “first” to review. Given, I have had the device for over a week now thanks to a giveaway, tried both coils that came with the UForce T2 tank, and have had quite a bit of experience with it, I feel my review will be useful. So let’s dive in on, what my opinion is, the big three.

1. Response time: Honestly, I have never experienced a more responsive vape. Given I had the original Drag, the new gene chip seems to take it a step beyond. As soon as I hit the button, a cloud of vapor forms. To me it’s a beautiful thing, to others who prefer a slower response time, this is probably not for you. Well... either it’s not for you, or you’ll have a change of opinion because voopoo definitely did this right. 9.6/10

2. Flavor: This one is a bit touchy for me because prior my daily was the drop dead rda and is currently my favorite rda. Prior to the drop dead, I had the dead rabbit. Both phenomenal in sense of flavor and I’ve never really been a tank kind of guy. That said, the UForceT2 ank came with one of the higher end accessories I feel is necessary to have a large amount of flavor with a tank, mesh coils. Honestly haven’t had this good of an experience with a tank... ever. The flavor is there and on point. The only downside I’ve had from the coils is that they have a very short life for me, roughly 3-4 days each. This isn’t saying much though, I’m rather hard on my coils (just switched from 50mg salt nics on the voopoo panda to 6mg juice on my drag and now my mini) so I could have fired them too long hoping for a stronger nicotine feel. All in all flavor is solid, the tank is nice, and the mesh coils produce some very clean flavor. 7.1/10

3. Battery life: as you may know, or not, the mini has an internal battery and let me start off by saying it is abysmal. There hasn’t been a single day where I’ve managed to not get caught out somewhere and the device be dead on me. Now before you assume I don’t charge it often enough, let me intervene, I charge it fully, twice a day. Yes, twice a day. Not sure if I’m the only one with this issue but it has been going from fully charged to full dead twice a day. Now, I’ll give them some slack on this, I’ve been off work for a few weeks now due to an injury and I have all the time in the world to vape. Also, I’m used to charging once every 2-3 days using dual 18650s so this throws me for a curve. 6/10

Figured I’d add a little more, just because of the sheer beauty of this mod. The resin design is an eye grabber, and they send a matching mouth piece to boot. Aside from the battery, it is a very solid device. The different fit modes are nice, it’s like recommended settings which simplifies meeting the needs of the different vapers (cloud chasers and flavor heads) while offering a battery conservation mode that I obviously need. I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting to vape or anyone who needs something compact that can dish out some power. Overall, not including all the other modes and perks of the mini, I give it an overall score of a 7.5/10. My apologies if I sound like a voopoo fan boy due to all the products of theirs that I own.

t3_9stbpv,Pizza Dave delivers - A pod system review - The RunAbout by Joyetech,"  

Hello everyone, Pizza Dave here, delivering you a review of the Runabout pod system by Joyetech. The folks over at Joyetech must be feeling gnarly, as this go around introduces a pod system that has the look of a surf board. Yep, surf board vaping review coming right up. Let’s hit the waves, see what’s up with this vape, and as always, I will see you down at the bottom for my final thoughts.

&#x200B;

DISCLAIMER: This device was sent to me by [Joyetech](https://www.joyetech.com/product/runabout/) for review.

**OPERATION**

Once you get past the fact that this looks like a toy surf board, you will be pleasantly surprised at what Joyetech has put together here. They incorporate the usual 5 click on, 5 click off operation as well as some settings for a color changing LED. The LED illuminates the fire button and the tank section. To change the color, power up the device, and then click the fire button 3 times rapidly. Press the fire button to cycle between the colors of red, yellow, blue, indigo, white, purple, or no light. The manual also indicates what certain flashes of the LEDs mean in terms of faults, but it doesn’t say much about battery indication. I had hoped they used the Exceed Edge battery level indication, which flashes at different speeds to show various levels of battery, but that isn’t the case on this one. Once you release the fire button, it will slowly flash if the battery is “fuller” and it will flash more quickly when it is low. It gave me a bit of a head start with the flashes and wasn’t directly dead when it started to flash fast, but I still popped it on the charger right away just to be sure I could get through my second day of work with it. The battery life is solid from the built in 480mah battery. I was able to use this all day at work without it running out. I got partway through day two before I was getting the rapid flash sequence of the LED and stuck it on the charger.

**HOW IT VAPES**

I pretty much blew this thing off right away when I got it and judged it by the cover big time. I was pleasantly surprised by the vape it provides. It puts out quite a bit of vapor for a pod system and sticks out in my mind as one of the biggest cloud producing pods I have used to date. With that vapor comes some great flavor, and it also tests high in the flavor department of pods this year. Liquid consumption is satisfactory, as it outlasts a battery charge, so it is equipped to get through a work day or night out no problem. The odd shape of this thing actually feels amazing in hand, and in pocket. I love how it feels in the hand, and it also has a solid feel thanks to a more solid feeling metal frame. The leds are a nice touch for seeing liquid levels in the dark, but also showing at least a slight indication of battery level. Filling the pods is not quite as convenient as the Innokin EQ because this uses a swiveling rubber plug method like other pods before it. It can get messy with dropper bottles, and you are almost guaranteed to get liquid on your fingers. Small con, there but not too terrible. I filled the first 2ml pod 6 times during my testing before flavor started to degrade, but the life goes a little beyond that. It also works well for those of you that use thicker liquids. I was using 70/30 nic salt liquid and it had zero issues with wicking.  I only ran into a couple of slight cons with the pods and wicking throughout my test. It would gurgle a bit if I refilled and let it sit for a while. After I ran the pod for a while and let it sit for days it would be flooding. I pulled the pod, blew through it into a paper towel and it cleared out through the air flow inlet and I was good to go again. Considering this pod system must lay on its side, this can be expected if you leave it sit a lot. It didn’t happen often, but it did happen.

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Another day, another pod system. At least this time around, Joyetech went for something different and it turns out to be stylish (subjective pro), and solid overall. I love how sleek and small this one is, and like the look of the patterns they offer. There is a color for just about everyone. I DON’T like that it looks like a toy, as it has the look and feel of a die cast surf board. It reminds me of those toy skate boards that were cool in the 90s, so maybe nostalgia will get a win for some here. There are few cons with this device. The toy surf board look will be a con for some, but the only two actual cons I found were the flooding and gurgling when it sat, and the lack of better battery indication. I always like when there is at least a 3-stage led indication to show the range of battery, but this device like many pod systems, gives you a last-minute indication of the battery being low. I was able to run it a little longer after the rapid battery flashes, so at least it wasn’t totally dead, but an earlier notice would be a huge improvement. I think the biggest hurdle this one has is the styling. I can see it clashing with many, and it looks a lot like a toy. However, it provides everything you need, in a small package that stands out in the pod market and performs in the middle to upper tier of pod systems I have tested.

&#x200B;

**THE OVEN TEST**

If this one accidentally went into the pizza oven, would I go out and buy another? Like I say with most pods, probably not. A new one will be out in a week, but this is not bad by any means.

REVIEW CRITERIA: I use each item for about two weeks to ensure I have collected enough data to adequately write a review. I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used it enough to give an educated review. The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying it and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \*\*\*\*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.",Tue Oct 30 16:31:08 PDT 2018,pizzadave80
t3_9stbdw,When to lower nicotine...,I was just curious on maybe when I should shoot to lower my nicotine mg. My personal goal is to get completely off of nicotine. Just a little background I have been smoking cigs consistantly for about the past 8 years and I just switched to only vaping 12mg juice last month. I surprisingly have not really had any cravings for a cig since. I am wondering if I can go ahead and drop my mg amount or if I should play it safe and try the same amount for another month or what. I am not sure how it might affect me and maybe some of you here have some good thoughts about it.,Tue Oct 30 16:30:12 PDT 2018,hungryhoustonian
t3_9st9qu,Need help with vaping kits that would run 100% VG juices without burning,"I am experiencing issues with breathing while vaping - my nose gets swollen and congested from the inside.   
I may have developed an allergy to low quality PG flavourings since I've been vaping on DIY liquids for a few years now.   
I didn't have problems with breathing in my first year of vaping.   
Now I think it's either the flavorings, testing 60/40 PG/VG 0 flavour right now and I'll see how it goes.  
If I'm allergic to PG itself, I'll need to switch to vaping 100% VG with no flavours I guess.   


Since I had quit smoking and vaping for 6 months prior to me starting vaping again last month, I really can't be asked to build coils and wrap cotton again. I'm looking for a small device that comes with factory made ready to install coilheads and that can smoothly run a 100% VG  juice setup, preferably with a satisfying mouth to lung usage.   


I used the aspire breeze 2 for like 3 weeks until the battery \*blew up\* died in my hand while firing, horrible burnt rubber/battery/cable smell from it, gave me a headache.   
Bought the Mi Pod 2 days ago, having a good run with it although I don't like that it doesn't support mouth-to-lung hits as much as I'd like to.  Is the Mi Pod suitable for 100% VG or I need another wider vape.   
Help greatly appreciated.",Tue Oct 30 16:24:38 PDT 2018,swavxxxnomore
t3_9st7fo,Help with a build for single 21700 mod?!,So I recently won a Desire Xmini mod and I have a set of Ampking 21700's that I won a while back too.  I am using a Solomon 2 RTA on it at the moment and the batteries die super fast.  I'm talking like 2 1/2 to 3 hours max.  My current build is .38 ohms and I'm running it at 45 watts.  So my question is would i better off building a lower resistance coil?  Or a higher one?  I've been using dual 18650's for so long I'm kind of lost.,Tue Oct 30 16:17:15 PDT 2018,jackfairy80

EDIT: I got the first box today and I love the flavors. It had alot of strawberry flavors in it, which I love strawberries. Bottle Size and cost are great. Shipping time (Washington State to California) took 3 days because I placed my first order on a Saturday. I like Zamplebox b/c I domt have to drive 20 mins to get vape juice.

Been vaping for 2 years now and as far as RTAs go, I have only used the OBS Engine and a Reload clone. I'm looking to buy the Augvape Intake. It has all the features I want - leak proof, single coil and seems to be easier to wick than the Zeus. But the reviews I've seen say it has a restricted draw, and that's fine, just as long as it is not a HUGE difference from the Engine or reload. 
Does anyone have an Engine or Reload AND the Intake to compare the airflow? Can turning the AFC to a certain position create the same restriction that you get with the Intake?

t3_9sqk62,RDA pieces don't fit back together,"I took apart my RDA (Ammit MTL RDA) for cleaning, let it dry and just went to screw the 510 pin back into the positive plate. The problem is that even though I tighten the screw all the way in, the positive plate is still loose and rattling around on the deck. 

I tried installing the squonk pin it came with instead and that works fine, screws right in and everything is secured. Looking at the pins side by side, it looks like the threading on the squonk pin is longer and therefore able to screw all the way in and be secure. 

I have no idea what is going on. The 510 pin was absolutely fine when I first put the RDA back together, no issues with screwing it in whatsoever. I don't know what can have happened in the week it was in use but clearly something isn't sitting right.

Any ideas what's happening? I'm assuming I'll have to source a new pin but was wondering if this had happened to anyone else. ",Tue Oct 30 11:19:57 PDT 2018,punchself
t3_9sqfho,Foment [review] - What are you afraid of? It's the Vandy Vape Phobia v2 RDA!,"What’s up folks? Today I’ve got an RDA to discuss with you that comes with a lineage to live up to, the [Phobia V2](http://vandyvape.com/atomizer/rda/atomizer/rda/phobia-v2-rda/) from [Vandy Vape](http://vandyvape.com/)! The atomizer was sent to me by Vandy Vape for the purposes of this review. The Phobia V2 shares a building platform with its older sibling, but not a ton else. So let’s take a look at what changed, and whether or not the changes helped the atty out.

#Photo Dump

#Atomizer Aesthetics
--------------------------------------

Looking at the RDA you’d get the impression from the 3 vertical airflow slots that it’s most likely geared toward cloud production, and that’s about half true. The RDA isn’t terribly busy looking though, the rather large logo does take up a full side of the top cap. The 3 included drip tips vary from somewhat unconventional to a flush lip-less ultem cap which is in and of itself quite unique in my view. The other two caps are either a grooved, but otherwise pretty normal 810 tip or a domed tip with a gearlike series of notches at its base. Of the three the clear favorite for me was the grooved tip. The gearlike protrusions on the domed tip are both a bit busy in design and are less comfortable in practice, while the flush cap just doesn’t really feel comfortable to me.   The airflow is, as mentioned earlier a trio of vertical slots, which as their stated interest is flavor appears a somewhat dubious decision. The rather thick inner cap does reduce the size of the chamber notably though, which also limits your build size a bit despite the deck design. From the outside it’s different enough to be visually distinct from its predecessor and its peers, while not being so garishly designed as to make people do a double-take when they see it on your mod. I rather like the simple wave below the airflow and I feel that including that alone in the design is enough to differentiate it from many others without really venturing into larger branding. I could do without the stylized logo that covers one side of the cap between the airflow but it is generally inoffensive.

#Build Deck
---------------------------------

I love postless decks, so this is right up my alley. While not being strictly postless, and more of a top-insert post system, It’s a pretty straightforward setup. I found building on this deck to be incredibly easy, especially with the included tool for clipping your leads. The build deck does also, because of the raised posts, offer an ample juice well. The included squonk pin is a nice touch, and for those of you unconcerned with portability it could certainly pair well with something like the Desire Rage. Worth noting, the large blocks on the top cap to direct the airflow do fall into a bit of a notch, but not until the very end of the alignment. This could have been handled better assuring that the cap never touches the coils or otherwise is misaligned. The cap does, again reduce the chamber somewhat, but not so much as to prevent somewhat larger builds if you’re either creative in your coil placement. 3mm ID seems the natural fit for the deck, but there’s still plenty of room to go larger. 

#Performance
------------------------------

As with many RDAs, the stated focus is on maximizing flavor with an appealing deck. The blocks do help to a point, but because the airflow adjustment leaves quite a vertical height to cover, and can only be shut down side to side rather than top to bottom I feel it falls into something of a middle of the pack designation for flavor. It is however quite capable of producing nice thick clouds. The airflow design lends itself better to cloudier builds as the only airflow setting that isn’t an awkward 3 slots ½ open scenario or uneven positioning with one or two slots open is the full open position. With the air fully open and the included coils, or any of the 3 or 3.5mm builds I’ve tried it’s a rather airy vape, and while flavor isn’t lacking it’s not really the focus. I didn’t bother to build it as a single coil atomizer as it would leave a pretty significant gap between the coils and the airflow. Generally I have found that any dual coil atomizer in a single coil configuration doesn’t really hold a candle to a well designed single coil atomizer’s flavor. With 2 of the slots open the flavor improves a bit, but with the air hitting the coils unevenly it could have been focused differently to maximize the deck’s potential. Worth noting is that chain vaping doesn’t really seem to heat up the top cap meaningfully, and certainly not to a point of discomfort.

**Pros:**   
* Incredibly easy to build   
* Deep juice reservoir    
* Squonk compatible   
* Natural and open draw with airflow wide open   

**Cons:**    
* Airflow design prevents it from reaching its full potential   
* Inner top cap should be forced to align with the deck more stringently   
* Should have included a single more normal drip tip

#Final Thoughts
-------------------------------

I like it for what it is. If someone tried to sell me on it purely as a flavor forward atomizer I’d have been, rightfully, skeptical. That is not to say that flavor is outright lacking, but that it could have been better with a small change to the design and it would have been a markedly nicer experience overall. If you’re hunting for a very easy to build RDA that can push some nice clouds, or you value the size of the juice well, it’s certainly not a bad option, but if maximizing flavor, or a more restrictive direct lung experience is your preference it’s not likely to impress you.

#Thanks for reading!

I've been vaping for about the last 4 years and recently I've been using nic salts in the ""mi-pod"" vape, very similar nicotine content to the juul (50mg nic salt). Over the past few weeks I've gotten little pings of pain in my nerves, cramping, and strange itchy pings aswell. To me it seems like blood constriction due to over consumption of nicotine. I can't find anything on this anywhere on the internet however and it really scares me. Maybe this is completely unrelated to nicotine but it seems to lessen when I don't hit the vape as much. I would say I go through about 1ml of juice or less a day. If anyone has any info it would be much appreciated, I'm trying to stop all together but I'm very addicted to nicotine :(

t3_9spyno,Some coils not fitting RTA deck.,"I've been building my own coils since the days of vivi nova tanks and vision spinners and my god has it changed lol.  Since then I have pretty much been using twisted 28 gauge kanthal, but recently I've wanted to try building some of the more advanced stuff like claptons and fused claptons.  I made about a foot of fused clapton coil with 24 gauge core and 32 gauge wrap.  Now I recently moved from a wotofo troll to a geekvapes creed tank, I broke the glass to the troll and didn't have a spare.  
So I tried a dual 6 wrap 2.5mm fused clapton coil and its just too damn wide to fit the air chamber over.  If I go to 4 wrap then I'm looking at .1 ohm and I usually build around .5 or so. 

[4 wrap on steam engine](https://i.imgur.com/RJfWAGc.png)

In appearance, skrr is a little bigger. It comes with a glass of 8ml (of course it can be changed to a 5ml version with a 5ml glass)

The intake design is similar. There are three large intake holes.

Skrr adjusts air intake more smoothly than cascade baby

Also skrr tank is compatible with all Vaporesso GT Coil

The way of filling the oil is different.

Skrr tank must be unscrewed to open the top cover. Fill the oil from above. This is a design that prevents opening.

This design will make the oiling a bit more troublesome, but I don’t think it will affect it.

&#x200B;

In the absence of significant differences

In fact, as a new TANK, the biggest change is also the most anticipated. The new Coil

A total of three innovative coils released

\-QF Strip Coil

\-QF Meshed Coil

\-SK CCELL Coil

As only QF Strip Coil and QF Meshed Coil in the package

There is no SK CCELL Coil (I think because there is little difference in ceramics)

&#x200B;

QF's Coil, made a change in Coil air intake

He added a bullet-shaped inner structure inside the Coil to let the air in from the bottom not come directly into the mouth.

But after inhalation, spread out through the bullet-shaped inner structure, into the mouth by inhalation.

This kind of design is a very innovative. At least I have not seen other manufacturers have such a special design.

I am getting the Skrr Tank and I am most expecting that this is often this Coil.

&#x200B;

I tried it with my favorite licky13.

I found that its taste is delicate and very delicate. It also makes the throat a little more comfortable.

Smooth on the suction resistance

I saw other people commenting badly on QF Coil because of the taste.

Instead, evaluate GT Mesh Coil better.

My own feeling is that GT Mesh Coil tastes really straight and very good.

However, QF Strip Coil & QF Meshed Coil is added to the bullet-shaped inner structure.

Air intake is not the most direct, slightly causing the taste to weaken

But after being weakened, it is more delicate.

Slowly sucking, slowly exhaling, there will be different feelings, I personally like it very much.

Then slowly vent the smoke in the exit.

After all, he made the 6mg Licky13 more comfortable.

One important point is that GT Mesh Coil will be stressed for every time I fill.

When I close the e-juice hole, I will squeeze a lot of e-juice from the middle of Coil to cause leakage.

However I use QF Coil without e-juice leak

I care very much about this. After all, I hate e-juice leaks.

&#x200B;

The life of QF Coil I think is durable. Maybe the root Flax Fiber with Cotton

I used 120ML of e-juice in a week to disassemble it. There is no obvious carbon.

I put it in 100 degrees of hot water and picked it up. I feel very good. No special cotton burns.

&#x200B;

Skrr is designed to be very easy to use.

Checking e-juice's remaining capacity is also much easier than the cascade baby.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the same time, QF Coil will be my first choice in the future. Second is GT CCELL.

&#x200B;

GT CCELL believes that everyone has used

Life tastes very good and there is no e-juice leak

This time I put the focus on the top of QF Coil.

After all, this is a special innovation.

&#x200B;

I took some photos about skrr tank for everyone's reference.

t3_9sowu8,The Hastur Mini MTL RTA from Cthulhu Mods: An Anxious Review,"Hey everyone!! /u/AnxietyAttack2013 here again! Today we’ll be taking a look at another MTL RTA. The Cthulhu Hastur mini MTL RTA, which I guess would be the little brother to the full sized Hastur MTL RTA. So enough with the introductions. Let’s get on with things!

Disclaimer: this atomizer was sent to me by Cthulhu mods for the purpose of a review. I will not let that fact, nor my feelings for the company, affect my views and opinions. 

______________________________________________________________

**so what’s in the box Anx?**

[picture album ](https://imgur.com/a/ANGeGcs) 

Not a box actually. We’re back to tins! Inside the tin is a nice foam insert. Quite a change from the fancier packagings we’ve seen recently from Cthulhu. No pouch. No felt lined box. Just a tin with a foam insert. But as we’ve learned in the past, packaging isn’t everything. 

Inside the tin we find:

The Cthulhu Hastur mini MTL RTA 

A frosted glass tank section

A stainless steel drip tip

A bag of o rings and screws

This retails for $27.60 from where I found it. 

**oh no....not another Hastur MTL RTA....is this  going to be as bad as the first one? ...okay okay I’ll stick to the script! What’s the first impression Anx?**

I’m glad you asked! And thanks for sticking to the script! So the first thing I noticed with this was how bare the packaging for this is compared to previous offerings we’ve seen from Cthulhu Mods. No felt lined tin with pouches and fanfare. Just an atomizer sitting in a foam insert. 

This is definitely a mini though. 22mm compared to 24mm, and at least half the size of the full size. Even with the longer stainless steel tip it includes, this is fairly small. Which I would hope translates to good flavor. 

This does look pretty similar to the full size with the filling system and that definitely filled me with flashbacks to the full-size. So I twist the top with much trepidation. And to my immediate, pleasant, surprise, it moved with no issue. Smooth as dairy free butter. Well that’s different!! And definitely filled me with a little more confidence. So I look at the airflow. And I’m met with three settings. All three are very MTL focused. 

Now this is starting to feel too good to be true. So I unscrew the tank and check the glass. And sure enough, not loose in the least! Oh happy day!! 

The deck itself goes back to the original kayfun/subtank mini style which I don’t prefer to the original Hastur RTA, but given the size of this I do understand. There really isn’t a ton of room to build on with this but as a kayfun user I’m pretty familiar with that. However, people who are used to more modern MTL build decks may find it a little cramped. 

Gone are the airflow inserts now too!! This has a diffused airflow underneath the coil. Which looks exactly like the one airflow insert I wanted to use in the full sized but didn’t fit. Two small holes lay beneath where your coil will go. 

Overall, it seems like every issue I’ve had with the full size has been fixed. But this is only what’s going on with build quality, not with performance.

**wow!! I’m actually pretty surprised by that. But we all know what happened when you tried building the full size. How was building the mini?**

Upon seeing the build deck for this I knew I wasn’t about to fit my usual fused clapton MTL build in this so out came the 24ga kanthal. “Maybe this will fit” I thought to myself. So I wrapped up a 6 wrap 3mm 24ga contact coil and placed it in the posts. And wouldn’t you know it fit like a glove. So I screwed it in and snapped off the leads. Then I got it glowing nicely and reading at 0.56 ohms. But fitting in the posts is one thing. Let’s see if this will touch the bell at all and short out. So before I even wicked it (remembering what happened last time) I screwed on the rest of the tank and fired it with hesitation, checking the resistance as I did so. Fortunately it stayed at 0.56 ohms. No shorting!! 

It is important to note that your build will have to stay lower to the deck as this can probably short out pretty easily considering how little space you have. But from my own personal experience, I haven’t had this short on me once. 

So next came the wicking. And this part can be a little tricky. I found wicking it similar to the Griffin 25mm works best where you let the cotton rest on the juice channel ring and only slightly enter it. Otherwise it is possibly and in fact likely to get flooding or dry hits. Which I did have happen to me a few times. 

While flooding and dry hits can happen with incorrect wicking, I have not once had this leak on me. 

Juicing this up also went without issue. The top cap (which gave me so much issue on the full-size) unlocked with ease. The fill ports are a little small for the nozzle of my 120ml bottle but it wasn’t messy or anything. And the actual act of filling took no time at all. 

Overall though, throwing my first build in here went way way better than expected. And it was actually pretty easy and pain free. 

**really? Pain free you say? Well that’s quite a difference from the last Hastur RTA. So how was actually using it? How’d it perform?**

Okay, so I set my wattage for 25 watts which is my usual starting point and while it wasn’t burning at all, it was way too hot. So I turned it down to 19 watts. And with the tightest airflow, this provided a warmish and dense vape. At the second and third airflow setting (from tightest to loosest) 23 watts felt very comfortable and still provided a warm vape. 

The airflow itself is very very smooth. Very similar to the ammit MTL RDA in terms of smoothness. And man does this get tight. At its tightest I would say this is a slightly looser traditional MTL inhale. At its loosest, it feels very similar to the ammit MTL RDA on it’s second tightest airflow hole or the siren v2 on it’s 3rd. So not a hugely versatile airflow but it doesn’t need to be. This knows it is MTL and it doesn’t try to be anything else. 

Setting the airflow can be a little difficult however. It is very firmly in place. Moving it while on a device may not be the easiest thing to do. Even off of the device it takes a fair bit of force to move. So on the one hand, you can be certain this will not move much in your pocket. On the other hand, it is very much a set and forget airflow. If you are moving your airflow a lot throughout the day, you may get frustrated by it. 

**but the flavor...the vapor...what about those??**

At 25 watts, this was a hot vape with very little flavor. Lowering this to 21 watts however cooled it down to warm and brought out a ton of flavor. A very impressive level of flavor. Better in fact that anything I’ve used since my kayfun v4. Possibly on par with it actually. Of course this is build dependent, but i am very impressed, especially considering the let down that the full-sized Hastur was. 

Vapor production isn’t bad. Of course, this isn’t a cloud chasing RTA in any way, but it’s satisfying for me. Much much less vapor than the full sized Hastur, the siren v2, and less than most other modern MTL atomizers I’ve used, but again...satisfying enough for me. 

One thing to note, and this is likely due to the lower wattages I use this at, but the throat hit on this a little lighter than with other atomizers I use. This is with using the same juice I made myself in all of them so that isn’t a factor in things. I’m only a few watts under my usual 23.5 watts and I’m getting less of a throat hit. Not too much less, but less all the same. So that is something to keep in mind. 

**Kayfun level flavor??? That’s some high praise there Anx. But there’s a lot of info here. Gimme those pros and cons I love so much!**

A please would be nice. But sure, why not. 

**pros**

Super smooth top cap lock

Glass stays in place when tank is disassembled 

Airflow stays in place

Amazing flavor 

Easy to build

Smooth airflow

A good looking atomizer

Traditional MTL and Modern MTL airflow range. 

Has not leaked on me. 

**cons**

Wicking can be tricky at times

Prone to flooding and or dry hits when wicked incorrectly 

Vapor production is slightly below average. 

Not a great juice capacity at 2ml

Airflow can be hard to move. 

Throat hit is a little light to me. 

Fill ports can be a little small for some bottles. 

**hmmm...some interesting pros and cons. This could go either way I feel...what are your final thoughts on this?**

I feel like this is a definite improvement over the full sized in almost every way. Getting rid of the airflow inserts, reducing and restricting the airflow, making the top cap smoother and easier to put on and take off, making the glass more secure, and having much better flavor. It does have a few quirks with building and with its wicking, but it still hasn’t actually leaked on me. The vapor production isn’t amazing but I feel it is still acceptable. 

So you guys should all know my philosophy by now. Don’t take one reviewer as the gospel. Do more research to become more informed. But with that said, this is something I definitely recommend. The cons it has are pretty minor in my opinion and while I might not say this would be a great atomizer to learn to build on I would say this would be a great atomizer for anyone interested in MTL vaping or anyone who wants what I would say is the best MTL flavor atomizer I have used since I first bought my kayfun v4. 

_______________________________________________________________

So that’s what I’ve got for you guys today! Quite a shift from the full sized Hastur MTL RTA but on the bright side, it’s a quite a shift from the full size Hastur MTL RTA. And I’m quite happy to recommend this one. But if you’ve seen me around here, you’ve probably already seen me recommend this one. Anyway, thank for reading!! Till next time, hope to catch y’all in the late night chat thread tonight!

It's been a year since I started vaping again. I'm really familiar with rebuildable as I have always been vaping on rta with simple kanthal wire.

I noticed that, unlike kanthal my ss wire get to a blue color with a new coil when I first fire it. Then after a week or two and a rewick / dry burn every days (mtl with 26g wire and NET juice wrecked my cotton in a day or two max) it gets to a brown color like the picture bellow

t3_9smiuo,Uwell Ironfist or OBS Cube,"Hello all.  
I am new to the scene and had a question for someone who is far more experienced then I am.  
  
First off I am currently trying to quit smoking cigarettes and wants to venture into the vaping world. I’ve tried JUULs and all that but it is not what I have been looking for. 
About two months ago I went out and got a Aspire Pockex. For a little bit it was working and I cut back cigarettes massively but slowly made my way back to them as it wasn’t giving me what I needed. Mainly I’ve come to realize that I want to “cloud chase” as my friend filled me in on.  Also the flavors of the ejuices has been a big check for me as I want flavors with my smoke.  
  
I have done some research but honestly don’t know what to choose when it comes to these two kits.  
Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",Tue Oct 30 03:14:51 PDT 2018,druknirish

t3_9smgk4,How much $ do reviewers make from designing RDA's for Chinese companies?,"Always wanted to the know the answer to this question. Most reviewers downplay the amount and make it sound like they get a few bucks here and there but in theory it seems like they make much more than that.

Take a popular RDA like the Dead Rabbit, Recurve, or Drop. They still sell like hotcakes. IIRC Briant TVC said in one of his recent presentation videos that Digiflavor sold 20,000 Drops in the prior month.

If Brian only gets a single digit percentage cut of overall Drop sales that's still a decent amount of money.

20,000 x 30$ = 600,000$. 1% of that is 6000$. And that's just from the Drop. He also has the Drop Solo, Drop Dead, Topside and I'm guessing more projects in the works. 

Not bad for passive income. Unless I'm missing something here.

Does anyone have an idea of how much they actually make?",Tue Oct 30 03:04:10 PDT 2018,JimmyTheSafecracker

t3_9slcl8,Help Needed For My First Rebuildable,"Somewhat of a long post to add context to my situation but just a tldr: Got a Cleito RTA and replaced coils with prebuilt 28Ga/0.9ohm SS316L coils which taste absolutely terrible. Tried everything online but cannot use TC or have a higher wattage than around 31 watts without getting a chemical/ burnt taste. 

I recently bought an Aspire Puxos kit after liking both of my breezes for MTL use and wanted to get a mod for flavor and clouds when I’m at home. After running through the Cleito coils that were included (0.4 or 0.6ohms iirc) I decided to also get into rebuildables to bring down the cost. 

I bought the Cleito RTA for the Cleito Pro tank and with the included Kanthal coils the flavor and cloud production was incredible. It took a while to learn how to properly wick without getting leaks in the tank but in the process, I bent the coil out of shape and ran out of cotton so I bought Muji Cotton Pads and some prebuilt SS316L coils (28Ga/0.9Ohm) due to not feeling confident enough to make good quality coils. 

As of now it seems that I’m getting either burnt hits or the coil is burning too hot and slightly decomposing giving off a bad chemical taste. I read that you cannot dry burn SS coils like you do with Kanthal so I check for hotspots and even heating by turning off the lights and dry burning for about half a second at a time to a very dull red. The flavor is very dull while cloud production seems ok but not the same as before. Can’t take hits for more than 2 seconds or use TC even with a limit at 30w. My mod reads the coils at 0.46ohms but the current coil I have installed has jumped to 0.54ohms.  I can only vape at around 80 degrees Fahrenheit and about 31 watts before it having a burnt/terrible chemical taste. Really sucks wasting so much ejuice (especially Capone by SauceLA which has quickly become my favorite flavor) 

Any advice on how to go about finding coils that are about what I want (vape at 50-80 watts / 350-450 Fahrenheit with great flavor that doesn’t burn out after a 2 second hit) or know what I’m doing wrong with the coils? ",Mon Oct 29 23:21:00 PDT 2018,TheDudeWhoNeedsHelp

t3_9sks4r,Bad Flavor with Rayon,"I've tried wicking with rayon (Graham cellucotton) many times, and every time I try it I get a bad flavor off of it. It doesn't seem to matter if I wick it relatively loose or packed as shit, wash my hands like crazy, it always has a terrible taste that comes with it that never goes away. I've read damn-near every post about rayon on here and many other vaping sites and I just cannot figure out what I'm doing wrong. I keep hearing how awesome it is, with better flavor, better wicking and it lasts longer but it just doesn't seem to be working for me.

t3_9sk2en,OBS Crius 2 muted flavour,"Hey folks! 

Frequent reader but don’t post often. Have been looking for a tank to replace my aging Ammit 25 and decided to try out the Crius 2 based on hearing it was great for flavour. 

So far I haven’t been able to produce a build that comes even close to the Ammit in terms of flavour or vape density. I’ve tried the include coil as well as an Alien from AVS. Have rewicked it several times trying to find the flavour without success. It seems to be wicking (seeing the bubbles) and no dry hits, but no flavour either. 

I don’t have a pic of the build right now but can post one tomorrow when I take another stab at it. 

Any experience or tips?

t3_9sj4v7,Foggy Memories Smok Species Kit Review,"Hello again my ECR family. How's everyone doing this evening? Good, I hope. I'm back today with another Foggy Memory for you all. This time we are gonna be taking a look at the new [Smok Species Kit](https://imgur.com/a/zc7Kdjm) which is the sequel to the Alien kit. This item was sent to me for review by [Smok](https://www.smoktech.com/kit/species) which is very cool of them to provide the item for us to discuss here today. 


##Packaging
The Smok Species kit comes in a familiar smok packaging, a nice looking [sleeve](https://imgur.com/a/xCzZWL1) with a picture of the Smok Species kit on the front and story about the mod and a [contents list](https://imgur.com/a/SyTjdh3). The side of the sleeve has [pictures of the coils](https://imgur.com/a/nfOmWgu) for the new Baby Beast V2 tank. Slide the sleeve off and you find a [tall black box](https://imgur.com/a/k8iZeVO) with Smok written on the top of the lid. Lift that lid off and you will find the [Smok Species mod](https://imgur.com/a/r1GPADr) , looking sexy with its super gloss paint job. Lift the tray up and you find all kinds of stuff. [These accessories](https://imgur.com/a/fZY1RAk) include the new Baby Beast V2 tank, a straight glass for the tank, a spare coil, micro USB cable, spare o-rings and a manual, warranty papers and battery safety card.

##Baby Beast V2 Tank
The Smoke Species kit is gonna come with the Baby Beast V2 tank. The follow up to the tank that created the coil that is the current industry standard and is probably the most widely used Sub-Ohm tank, the Baby Beast, which premiered with Smok Alien kit in 2016. Starting at the top of the Baby Beast V2, you notice the first difference between this and the original, the [drip tip](https://imgur.com/a/fuGqmNb). Instead of having a Goon style 810 with o-rings on the drip tip, it's a [nub with a drip tip sleeve](https://imgur.com/a/olU3K8j) style. While that limits what tips you can put on it, I do want to say I really like this stock one. It's not too tall like I felt older Smok ones was too tall. Just below that change is the next big change, [the top cap](https://imgur.com/a/gfr8Anv). The top has a spring loaded button that springs the cap open when pressed and the [fill port](https://imgur.com/a/7p5DhBr) is revealed. You will notice you don't see a gasket around the fill port but, it's now on the [underside of the cap](https://imgur.com/a/B8I0GSX). I'm not sure if this spring loaded button mechanism or the new location of the gasket caused the new drip tip but, this configuration is the new Baby Beast V2 top cap/ fill port. It's been very mess free for me. Moving down is the tank section, pre-installed is the [super wide bubble tank](https://imgur.com/a/MDaO2V1) that holds 5ml of juice and a [straight glass](https://imgur.com/a/wvtq8q4) that holds 2ml-3ml of juice, I searched and couldn't find that capacity. The bottom has a typical [adjustable airflow ring](https://imgur.com/a/4WtMusu) with three holes and the perfect amount of restriction to move easily and stay in place. [Coils screw into the base](https://imgur.com/a/ArzIYFr) in your normal Sub-Ohm tank fashion and the coil screws into the chimney. Pick which glass you want to use and you got the Baby Beast V2. Also, it's worth noting that the paint on this tank looks fantastic.

##Baby Beast V2 Coils
I think we are all very familiar with a baby beast coil. They replaced the altantis style coils as the industry standard for size of coil and now the majority of Sub-Ohm Tanks take that size coil. With the V2 tank comes [new coils](https://imgur.com/a/pJDXPB2) . With this kit is a A1 0.17 single mesh and the spare is the A2 0.2 dual mesh coils. They are definitely bigger than the original baby beast coils and have some [interesting wicking channels](https://imgur.com/2pxmTDl) to keep the cotton fully saturated. 

##Smok Species Mod
The Smok Species, the follow up to the Smok Alien has some big shoes to fill. The Alien is probably the most sold and most widely recognized mod of all time. They definitely didn't hold back on the paint job because the red one I've tested has paint as nice as on a car. The Species mod is a dual 18650 device that vapes between 1-230 watts in power mode with a preheat of soft, normal and hard. Also, it vapes in TC mode for NI, TI and SS and allows you to adjust wattage for your TC. Six clicks turns it on instead of five and after the Smok Species boot screen, you get asked if [your 21 or older](https://imgur.com/a/teIpPTZ). Touch ""I'm 21 or older"" or the mod turns itself off. Starting [at the top](https://imgur.com/a/t4oJCgF), it has a spring loaded 510 with stainless steel threads. The platform at the top [holds up to a 28mm tank](https://imgur.com/a/gwtgnlu) without over and goes right to the edge of the bevel. On each side of the platform is a black strip that's extends from the [bottom of the screen](https://imgur.com/a/bksUssv) and wraps around to the [back of the mod](https://imgur.com/a/9jy3Ome).To the left side of the mod, is the fire Smok fire bar. Squeeze the mod to fire. The mod is a little more narrow at the bottom than the top and that allows for these [curves on the side panels](https://imgur.com/a/pzP79rY) including the fire bar. The shape of the mod, getting wider higher up, makes it comfortable to hold like the [Smok I-Priv](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/8xj3bq/foggy_memories_smok_i_priv_talking_mod_review/), which Is also very comfortable in the hand. The [back side of Species](https://imgur.com/a/ODFm1nD) says Species on a snake/honeycomb pattern that [matches my Smok Novo](https://imgur.com/a/fvl1db4). The opposite side has a nice [1.45in OLED color touch screen](https://imgur.com/a/v4YonAp). Below the screen is the only button on the mod other than the fire bar and a micro USB port is below that for firmware updates or charging. This button can unlock or lock the screen when the screen is displayed and with a quick click will turn the screen on or off. I want to say that the colors on this screen look really nice but my nice camera on my Galaxy Note 8 doesn't capture it very well for some reason. The [main screen](https://imgur.com/a/v4YonAp) shows your wattage in the center surrounded by a dial display that goes up the higher your wattage. The top right shows a gauge for each battery and the bottom corners display Ohms and Volts. On the top is a lock symbol when the screen is locked to the touch but if you hold the button for two seconds, the lock goes away and you can raise or lower your wattage on the dial or tap the icon in the top left to enter [the menu](https://imgur.com/a/0dk7PJ2). This allows you four options, settings, puff menu, [vape mode](https://imgur.com/a/rOyu40c) meaningwattage or TC and preheat and the [screen color and timeout](https://imgur.com/a/DM8JJ2Z). The screen color gives you six options for the color of your display. Anytime you are adjusting things on the touch screen, you can click the fire bar or screen button and lock the screen. That's it as far as menu. It has all the functionality of all other mods put right now but the menu is laid out incredibly well and easy to navigate. You can make adjustments and get back to vaping fast. At the very bottom is [the battery door](https://imgur.com/a/L9DQP94) and it's a new design, at least to me. It has a button in the center you slide down and that pops open the [spring loaded door](https://imgur.com/a/foq52V4). This door doesn't have any play or wobble when open and is thick. The way the door closes flush into the mod and is a thick door, it makes it seem more secure and less likely to get damaged in a drop. I haven't torture tested the mod to see what abuse the door can take but it seems stronger. It's also marked battery A and B on the door so you know which one if being represented on the screen.

##Performance
The Smok Species kit is the closest I've come to having a setup that rivels a fog machine. This tank has the most airflow I've ever used on a tank. It's like breathing, lol. That much air combined with these massive mesh coils creates serious cloud comp clouds with minimal effort. I'm a single coil Rta guy and I about needed to lower my nicotine. I liked both coils. They kept up well with those cut wicking channels, blowing clouds at 120 watts. You definitely get flavor when vaporizing that much juice. I personally liked the straight glass on the tank better and that requires a lot of refills through because of the smaller capacity. Top fill on the tank worked fine for me and I didn't have any residual juice from filling the tank. When I had the airflow fully open on the tank, it didn't whistle and wasn't super loud. Just sounds like a lot of air moving. Cutting the airflow down to half or more can make a little whistle sounds though. The mod itself feels nice in the hand. I mostly vape in wattage mode and the Species fires up fast when I'm vaping the Baby Beast V2 tank at 115 watts. When I'm vaping a single coil Rta at 30 watts though, it seems a little underpowered. If it's a tank I usually vape at 30 watts I might vape at 35 on the Species. Not a huge deal for me since you can easily raise your wattage. I vaped it in TC with SS fused clapton wire, single coil Rta. I didn't have any problems once I dialed it in. I'm not a TC expert but it gave me a good vape and prevented dry hits. The touch screen itself was very responsive and never gave me false hits or made me tap repeatedly, it just worked properly and quickly.

##Conclusion
After using this Smok Species kit extensively, I haven't found much to complain about. First off, this paint is [super gloss](https://imgur.com/a/Z5Lvh4t). That pic looks like it has a blemish but it's just the light. Mine doesn't have any scratches after all this use so I think it's not gonna wear off. The tank has nice features with the spring loaded button to open it and no mess with the gasket on top. Some people will not like the proprietary drip tip but it's comfortable and looks good. The coils have great wicking channels and create an incredible amount of vapor. The mod itself is small in size but has a centered 510 and holds up to a 28mm without overhang. The touch screen is on point and detects each gap. The menu is easy to navigate even though it doesn't lack features. The fire bar requires a tad more pressure to fire than previous Smok mods I've used. It took a bit to adjust to that but it could make accidental fires less likely. I love this battery door. The way it cradles into the mod seems simple but to me it's a step forward in making battery doors more durable. All in all, this is a fine kit from Smok and a nice relative to the Alien. The only negative is that to me, it seems underpowered at lower wattages. Turn up the wattage 5 watts and your fine. The touch screen, paint job and performance are all very nice.

Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it. It took me longer to write than I anticipated. Lots of little details on the Species. I really want to thank [Smok](https://www.smoktech.com/kit/speciesb). They make very nice mods and it was a pleasure to test it out! I've got a bunch more Foggy Memories coming very soon so I'll be back.

t3_9sieu7,Temp Control on Aegis legend (SS 316L),"Alright I'm kinda a newb here as far a posting goes, but I have about 3 years of vaping under my belt. I wanted to take some time to help out some Temp control junkies out there. 

It's widely known the legend is a durable beast but what you read online about its temp control features gives quite a bitter flavor. Before I continue I immediately updated my firmware to the latest ATM (v1.2) when I bought this product. There are a wide variety of issues that exist within the base firmware from uneven discharge of batteries to really crappy Tc functions. I won't go into too much detail as I said I spent no time with this product under the old firmware and can't advise that anyone else do. 

I use RTA'S, the kylin and a Fuji/s as my main tanks and often switch between rayon and cotton in builds. As of now im stuck on ss316L wire. It seems like it works better in wattage for flavor to me and is maybe a little more forgiving of my semi-sloppy builds in terms of heat than say kanthal. I use 22-26G roundwire builds mostly about 9-12 wraps. But on to the Temp control!

Starting in TC-SS mode will get you a TCR of 112 as of V 1.2 firmware. I would assume this is for SS316, though honestly you can use ss316L in this mode without too many problems the heat difference is probably in the range of 8-25 degrees (though I can't say i'm well versed in the algorithms at play and I am merely judging from a 2-day period of use under such circumstances.) After a bit of searching I found the TCR of SS316L should be anywhere between 87-101 depending on the mod which is frankly quite a spread. I generally prefer the higher ranges of that (94-99) but i also usually only go to about 205-215c. With a .34 ohm build, and I'm currently set to 33 watts in the TCR mode.

Okay so on hit (without drawing) the wattage flux is all over starting at 60W and going all the way down to 1 before hitting protection. while I'm drawing I see mostly 35-45 watts popping up. The end result is a super smooth sleeper hit with tons of flavor on the exhale. On the Kylin it's a really warm dense vape concentrated in the mids and lows. The fuji gets a pretty straight laced flavor which is a bit more room temp - cold feeling. the real pro of the fuji is it's EQ-like airflow, ya know like the one in your car stereo or your Iphone. Okay so I like music and like to equate flavor to different ranges in the taste spectrum. for example strawberry has a bright flavor and is punchy in the high end, whereas banana has a lower-mid range with subtle hints of high end. Thus was formed the strawberry-banana combo a very balanced flavor profile. I digress.

The vape control on the legend is pretty killer on the 1.2 update it may not be superior to a DNA chip but if you're like my wife and drop your mod various places (toilet, sink, concrete ETC.) and need something Rugged that also does a pretty banging job of temp controlling, the Legend may fit the bill. Some quick things to note in temp control with this mod:

Do not run the batteries below about 15-20% you will get some burn and temp flux it really functions best at full battery (luckily it take two) 

Second this guy can be really finicky with the ohmage of your coil which is part of the algorithm that temp control is based on. I tend to get it moderately warm after a few hits, reset the coil ohm's and lock it. If i unlock it it will drift up or down. if it drifts up i get burn, if it drifts down i don't get a whole lot of anything. So if you are having trouble definitely reset ohms and give it another go try and lock it when its hitting right and not when its hitting wrong.

&#x200B;

I think that's it I know most like their wattage mode but as TC improves I find it to be a pretty sweet alternative if you're willing to fiddle a bit. Let me know what you guys think of temp control in the Legend post V1.2 Firmware I would love to hear your thoughts. I love this mod and am always looking for ways to make it better. Thanks :)",Mon Oct 29 16:21:00 PDT 2018,whitewrabbit
t3_9sicwf,Goodbye ECR!,"September of last year I stopped smoking cigarettes and started researching vaping. I started lurking on ECR and learned a ton in my switch from cigs. I smoked a half pack of cigarettes a day for 5 years before I made the transition to an ecig, and I remember thinking how much easier the switch was than I thought it would be. I vaped for a year on my trusty Battlestar and VV Pulse 22, and I had a great time exploring juices recommended on the subreddit! As of the last month, I've been picking up the vape less and less, and for the last week, I haven't wanted to puff at all. This is the end of my cloudy journey, thanks for all the knowledge and help!

t3_9sibbe,Anyone else tried the new Vaporham Lincoln stuff from The Sauce LA?,"I bought a 120ml of America because it was only $7 and I'd heard great things about it years ago and honestly it's kind of awful. The flavor is good but it's just super dry and scratchy in my throat. The flavor is very nice but it's just not comfortable to vape at any wattage. I'm not horribly bummed because it didn't cost me much, but it is kind of a waste since I don't think I can vape this. Maybe I'm just sensitive to cheap nic - I find a lot of juices too harsh for me even at 3mg. Also sort of wondering if they're dumping off old stock with a new label or something. 

Incidentally I got the sample pack of Capone, Open Road, and Caramel Waffle Cappuccino and all three of those are amazingly good and will be definitely going into my usual lineup (eventually anyway, they're a bit expensive for my budget right now).

Edit: for real though I can't rave hard enough about Capone. If you like fruit loops style cereals this is The One. And the Caramel Waffle Cappuccino is not at all far behind it. ",Mon Oct 29 16:09:24 PDT 2018,champaignthrowaway
t3_9si9i1,Under $50 pod system for an ex-smoker?,"I really need the ""throat hit"" if I'm gonna stay off cigs. The second vape I've ever bought was the Smok Badge (i know, shitty, but was within my budget). I have tried other vapes, through friends, and owning one years ago  (just some cheap $20 setup)--all them tank-based, and never did get that good ""smoking"" feeling that i need; Also, I don't like how large and conspicuous they are, one of the perks of not smoking anymore is not being stared at by strangers with something ""vile"" in my hand. Also, the *feel* of the badge is great for combatting that finger hold craving (the craving of having something in between or around that area of my fingers where a cigarette used to be). 

I actually have LOVED the Badge as an alternative to cigarettes, and this is the first vape that actually has kept me off cigs so far. *BUT*-- I've only had it over 2 wks and already the battery is shot, also it misfires alot. Charges for hours at a time and then after 2 hrs using it moderately, not like I'm chain vaping or anything-- battery dies. This just happened in the last couple days.

 Soooo anyway, suggestions for something similar within my budget ($50 or less) that *isn't* pre-filled? Suggestions from actual current/ex-cigarette smokers would be especially appreciated. Suorin Drop is one im looking into, since I enjoyed the Badge (while it was working), and the badge seems to be just a rip-off of the suorin? Yea or nay? Or something better?

t3_9si8r7,Unregulated Sqounk Flavour?,"I’m currently running an Asmodus Ultroner X Luna Sqounk Mod with a Goon V1.5 tank with Ni80 dual coils (0.15ish) and cotton bacon. 

I saw a massive flavour improvement using Ni80 for coil material over Kanthal but compared to my big baby the flavour is still kinda underwhelming. 

I was wondering what else I can do to maximise flavour. I’m not interested in cloud chasing but flavour is really important to me. 

Am I better off getting a different RDA for flavour or building differently? 

I’ve heard about NiChrome etc but I’m told they are for TC and don’t really suit unregulated mods? 

The Goon v1.5 is okay, but it doesn’t seem to Sqounk especially well with juice distribution never exactly even. 

Am I better off getting a single coil RDA or changing the materials on my current build?

My question is, if I alternated the sweet jam monster type liquids with a tank of very strong straight menthol (like elixir M), would the light colored menthol juice sort of revive and filter that cotton a bit to help save the coil?  

Any other rules of thumb for what kinds of juice kill coils?

t3_9sgzpb,Considering Switching From Sub-Ohm to a Pod System,"I'm a flavor chaser and pretty much have been vaping 70 watts 3mg nic for the last couple of years, I'm interested in the pod systems because I think it would be cheaper down the line using less juice and (hopefully) burning through less coils.  Also the portability (I've been using a Reuleaux RX200 for years - thing is a brick). I just need more education on them. 

The only pod system I've actually been able to try is the Juul but the lack of a strong flavor and density just doesn't do it for me. So I was asking a guy working at my local vape shop about pod systems when I saw a customer buying a Craving Vapor Jynx kit because I hadn't seen anything like that before (I don't follow vaping news/trends, rarely even go into my local shop). I asked what system would give me the closest flavor and density to a sub-ohm and he suggested the iJoy Diamond VPC, the Craving Vapor Jynx or the Myle. 

Wondering if you guys think there's anything out there that really even comes close to a sub-ohm setup, and if so, what I would be looking at as far as being able to use the juices I regularly buy with refillable pods (70vg/30pg 3mg). I'm also clueless about salt nic juices. My understanding is most pod systems have to run pretty low on wattage so therefore you just really aren't going to get close to that flavor/density of a sub-ohm and need higher nic concentration.

So my questions are, is this mod suitable for wrapping your own coils? Should I used the premade ""notched"" coils or wrap my own? If I wanted to start wrapping my own, it seems I would want to go with 26g Kanthanal. The current resistance reading on my mod with the disposable coil is .26 ohms, is that what I would want to shoot for if I wrapped my own? How would I find out what resistance I would want to target?

t3_9sgmje,[Review] VooPoo Drag 2 Kit + Comparison to the original Drag,"# The Drag 2 Kit Review

Alright, I'll start off by saying the following. I received the Drag 2 for free one week ago from VooPoo as I was picked to test and review it from their [reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/9mo6mk/giveawaywanna_test_new_drag_2_mini_for_free_only/) I picked to test the Drag 2 (non mini version) since I already had the original Drag mod from VooPoo and I wanted to see how it compares. It's now been a week and I think I can finally give a comparative review of it. I'll start off with the technical information about the Drag 2 and after that I will state my personal opinions, as well as pros and cons.

**The Drag 2:**

* The Drag 2 is 88.3mm wide on top where the 510 connector is, which makes it 1.7mm thinner than the original Drag. The actual dimensions of the Drag 2 are 88.3\*51\*26.5mm
* The 510 connector moved from the very right to the center of the device
* The Drag 2 is 158 grams which makes it lighter than the original drag by the noticeable 46 grams.
* The Drag 2 has its edges smooth out and is generally less bulky than the original Drag.

The main on-board features from the original Drag are quite a step up with the Drag 2. VooPoo's Drag 2 can fire up to 177W which is a step up from the original Drag which only supported 157W.

The chip used in the original Drag is the Gene chip while the Drag 2 uses the Gene Fit chip. The new chip not only supports higher wattage output but it also supports 3 new FIT modes to switch between, each one doing exactly what it suggests:  
\* Battery Saving mode  
\* Flavor mode  
\* Cloud mode  
Apart from the innovation of the GENE FIT chip, it is also secured by a V0 class fireproof bridge to block dust, liquid or burnout. While VooPoo recommends UFORCE to be paired with the FIT modes, I also find that they work on RTAs/RDAs.  


The Drag 2 also comes in a variety of new resin plates such as the following:

* Island
* Flame
* Aurora
* Scarlet
* Fire Cloud
* Puzzle
* Dawn
* Ink

**The UFORCE T2:**  
You can choose to buy the Drag 2 Kit or just the box mod separately. The kit comes packaged with VooPoo's newest UFORCE T2 tank. Inside the box you of the kit you'll get a drip tip matching the colors of your Drag 2 mod.  
The UFORCE T2 sub-ohm tank comes with two coils in the package:

* UFORCE U2 (Dual coils, 0.4 ohm, Strong flavor structure, Power 40-80W, Best at 55-65W) 
* UFORCE N3 (Triple mesh coils, High acceleration power, Always keep the full and original flavor, Resistance: 0.2 ohm, Power 65-100W, Best at 75-85W)

The UFORCE T2 tank will also come with 2 glass tubes - a 2 ML (TPD) and a 5ML bubble glass tube. It is also important to note that the tank is compatible with all of the current UFORCE coils. The UFORCE T2 sub ohm tank comes with bottom airflow with 3 air holes which are on a stopper.  


**Personal experience with the Drag 2 kit:**

Alright so I'll begin with first impressions out of the box:  
 When I got the box I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful it is. Vaping related companies should take serious note on what VooPoo does with their boxes because its a beautiful, very premium presentation. The experience was like opening a brand new phone's retail box. Amazingly executed, very professional and elegant.   
When you open the box you're greeted with your Drag 2 mod just exactly how the original Drag was. You then get this little string that you pull to reveal the contents of the lower section of the box. After you lift that up you're greeted with a nicely packaged warranty card, a gene chip authenticity card, and two manuals - one for the drag mod and one for your tank. The box also includes a little bag of silica gel to keep it nice and dry from any moisture. Don't eat that please.   
I attached the tank to the mod, threw in some 18650's and turned it on. I was honestly super pleasantly surprised by how steady, nice and comfortable it felt in my hand. Those smooth edges were a huge step in the right decision. Yes, it does kind of abstract itself from the retro box mod look, but it does that for the price of being extremely comfortable, so I'm not mad a single bit. The screen looked super flush. It had this little peel off sticker to prevent it from getting scratched, which is a nice detail really. While being flush and beautiful the screen is a lot darker than the previous Drag. Nothing unbearable though. And I'm sure you'll be able to adjust screen brightness soon when they add the Drag 2 support for the VooPoo software.

 I used the U2 coil which came pre-installed in the tank. I primed it and filled the tank. (70/30 juice) I drew a first hit and I was surprised by how smooth it was. The tank is not one of the quiet ones for sure, the airflow is loud but is extremely pleasant and smooth. I assume both of those are because of the triple-sliding airflow holes.  


**Weekly experience:**  
Throughout the next week I tested out all of the possibilities of this mod and this tank. The coils in this tank are just amazing. I've been rocking this U2 coil for more than a week now. I changed 3 freaking juices and its still smooth, gives off amazing flavor and decent cloud production. The FIT modes are definitely noticeable with the UFORCE tank. I can't stand for how good the battery saver mode performs just because I haven't had the need to use it. However there are noticeable differences between the modes.   
The power, cloud mode has AMAZING ramp up time. It's literally instant. Heats up the coils super fast. I'm honestly very shocked at how powerful it is.    
The flavor setting is a bit weird to me but definitely works. Its ramp up time is slower and the heat is definitely much less with that mode even in the same wattage. If I vaped 40W in flavor FIT mode it feels like a 30W vape but with a lot more intense flavor.  
I tested the FIT modes both with the UFORCE tank and with my trusty ZEUS Dual. While I can confirm, yes, the results are much better with the UFORCE tanks I can definitely say that it works on RTA's / RDA's as well, just not to the same extent.   


**SCRATCH TEST:**  
I really wanted to test out if they fixed the paint issue. As most of you know the first Drag edition's black color had this huge problem of the paint wearing and chipping off. I really wanted to see if they fixed that with the second edition so I put it to the test:  
Throughout the week I've purposely scratched the mod, being with my fingernail, some metal objects, etc, etc.   
It really seems to me that they have fixed the paint issue. I've not had any problems with paint chipping off so far and the scratches I've caused on purpose look very minimal. It's a lot more difficult to scratch than the original Drag as well.

# PROS AND CONS:

**Pros:**

* Beautiful, rounded, comfortable design.
* 8 great color combos.
* It seems that they fixed the paint issue
* Superior ramp up time
* Great Price/Quality ratio
* Premium experience
* Improved battery life
* Higher max wattage, up to 177W
* 1/4th lighter than the original Drag 
* Innovative GENE FIT chip with 3 FIT modes
* Fit up to 26mm attys without overhang
* Paired with an amazing UFORCE T2 tank.
* Amazing, long-lasting coils in the box.
* Kit comes with a matching 810 drip tip with the resin color combo you've picked. 

**Cons:**

* Rattling/loose battery door
* Resin panels are non-replaceable 
* Screen is very dim (which might get patched via software updates)
* Feels a little more slippery than the first Drag mod (not anything major though)

# In conclusion:

In conclusion I'd say that this is an amazing kit that is definitely worth its price tag. It delivers a very premium experience and I believe it is a very big step up from the original drag. I believe this is a great purchase even if you already own the original Drag. It delivers an even better performance and reliability. This feels like a very durable mod.  


Thank you to everyone who took time to read my review! <3  


*Note that I am not getting paid to promote this mod. I am simply stating my personal opinion from my experience with it through the past week and a half. Everything said in the above review is 100% honest even though some of my opinions could be subjective and your experience with it might be different.*

t3_9sfra0,Really can't decide... Nitecore D4 or xtar vc4?,"So I have done a ton of looking around on both of them and they seem to be just about equal I guess.  Im not someone who is going to be testing batteries but I want a nice charger that will hold up for my vaping needs.  My friend has a Nitecore that ive been using it's the i4 and I noticed that it doesn't seem to sense the charge level.  I had taken the batteries out mid charge because I thought I smelled something weird(Wasn't coming from the batteries) and when I went to replace them the led reset.  Then I noticed one battery was a click above the other and decided to switch their places and the LEDs didn't change at all leading me to believe the charger really only does well when you go from 0-100 without any interference.

Which charger out of the two is a little more hands off in your experience and or things you have read where I can just plop my batteries in and not have to worry if my batteries aren't at a lower level or whatever.  I am kinda leaning towards the vc4 since it can support 20700 and 21700 if I ever get a mod with those batteries.  Also where could I buy the vc4 if you recommend that because the website sends me to amazon but im always iffy about buying things like this on amazon tho if you know the correct one then by all means send/post the link.

t3_9sfp5p,"Foment review and a [giveaway] - the Call of Cthulhu, it's the 1928 MTL RDA!","What’s up folks? Today I’ve got an MTL RDA to discuss. This is the [Cthuhlu mods 1928 RDA](https://www.cthulhumod.com/1928-mtl-rda-true-mtl-nic-salts-rta/). The RDA was provided by Cthulhu for the purposes of this review (as was another one for a giveaway!)Designed for MTL or rather restrictive direct lung operation this is an RDA meant for nicotine salts and traditional higher nic mtl vaping as much or more than anything else. Is there really a place in the modern market for this design? Let’s discuss! 

#Photo Dump
--------------------------------

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/alwRGC8)

#Atomizer Aesthetics
----------------------------------

As has been their modus operandi, Cthulhu has remained quite sparse on ornamentation with this RDA. No branding exists anywhere on the barrel, but instead the RDA is a very smooth bell above a barrel bearing no markings but the air inlet holes. The drip tip options are rather long, though the fluted tip feels quite comfortable in their own right. I would love to see just a tiny bit of branding on Cthulhu’s atomizers. There’s nothing that really distinguishes this atty from anything else in a similar shape, and even a simple etched “1928” or Cthulhu’s logo on the barrel opposite the airflow would be a welcome addition to the design so as to add something small and recognizable to the exterior of the atomizer. There are 4 different diameter airflow holes on the side of the cap, and only one air inlet on the RDA. The design is pretty straightforward in that sense and they nicely notched the base of the RDA itself and the top cap so as to make sure it was always aligned with the airflow holes and air inlet aligned.

#Build deck
---------------------------------------------

The deck itself, the actual building platform, is actively an old school affair. The same deck you’d see in the Hastur mini seems to have been reused here. In that sense, I feel it could be much improved. The design does work, and I had only a modest hassle installing a fused clapton coil under the lead screws heads. The deck was meant for round wire though, and for that it is perfectly serviceable, even if neater decks do exist. More important than the deck itself, my primary concern with a mouth to lung RDA was that dripping would be a chore. This is resolved in two ways. The deck itself is raised significantly above the base of the RDA with a small pair of plates covering up much of the thus hidden juice well, and the RDA is squonk compatible. With the appropriate build it could be paired well with a 22mm mechanical squonker, but with so many single cell squonk devices on the market now, there are quite a few adequate homes for this RDA. The size of the build platform itself does limit your build notably, which given the design being geared toward MTL this is neither a real surprise nor a real problem. I’d love to see an updated deck, whether it be postless or a simple set of clamps either would greatly improve the ease of building with flat coils.

#Performance
---------------------------

The airflow is billed as offering options from tight to loose MTL, though I find it is more of a moderately tight MTL through loose MTL and into the realm of very restrictive direct lung. Insofar as actual performance, I rather like it. I do believe the RDA was meant to be paired with a squonk mod, given how tiny the drip tip is, squirting juice down the tip onto the coil is really out of the question, which leaves removing the cap or squonking. One of which is markedly more convenient than the other. The flavor on more mtl focused juices is quite good. Certainly beating out most pod systems handily and I feel it could go toe to toe with many other rebuildable MTL options. 

**Pros:**    
* Deep juice well   
* Variety of airflow options   
* Squonk compatible   

**Cons:**   
* Outdated build deck   
* Airflow could do with a tighter option  
* Nothing to visually distinguish it from the field

#Final thoughts
-------------------------------

It’s hard to really find a ton of fault here with the end result. I’d like to see a tighter draw than the present options give me, but even without it suits my needs. If you’re looking for something to pair with a single battery squonker and prefer MTL vaping it’s certainly worth a look. If you’re only interested in it as a dripper it is a bit more of a chore and I feel that a MTL RTA is a better option overall.

#Giveaway
---------------------------

Okay, so there’s not a ton of October left, but I love spooky stuff, and being that the RDA is from Cthulhu, it’s got me thinking: Tell me who your favorite horror author is, and if you’re not much of a reader tell me what your favorite horror movie is. The contest is open to anyone over the local legal age, and within the US. If you're elsewhere in the world and would still like to enter, you'll be responsible for shipping. The contest will be open until a winner is posted here. That *probably* means Friday or Saturday of this upcoming weekend, but sometimes things slip my mind, or life gets in the way so don’t hold me to it too strictly.

&#x200B;

t3_9scaps,Tested: The Pulse X kit by Tony B and VandyVape! Less than impressed and a rant about USB charging.,"**Intro:**

[Product Pics](https://imgur.com/a/6g9KcSz)

Let’s take a look at the latest offering by Tony B and VandyVape - the 90W, 21700 compatible, Pulse X kit. This kit was sent to me by VandyVape for review, thank you!


While I’ve been custom painting and converting mods into squonkers for friends ([VapeDroid C3D1](https://imgur.com/JHFvqbo), [Noisy Cricket](https://imgur.com/BrTtcfa), [Cuboid 200](https://imgur.com/FDMSGC9) - shameless plug ;)), I’ll have to admit I’ve never really gotten into it myself. I was really keen to get my hands on this kit and give it a try.

&nbsp;

In the Pulse X kit you’ll get a bunch of goodies including:

- The Pulse 90W mod
- The Pulse X RDA
- Extra clear top cap for the atomiser
- Accessories including spare o-rings, spare screws, 28x3 + 38 fused clapton coils, screwdriver
- USB cable
- User guide

&nbsp;

Pretty much everything you need to get going, sans battery and cotton. Speaking of batteries, you’ll want to get a 21700 for this mod. That’s why the Pulse 90W version exists right!? Depending on the wattage you’re running at, I’d suggest something like a Samsung 40T for up to 60-70W and a 30T for above. Being a single cell mod, there’s no way of getting around the fact that battery life at the higher wattages isn’t going to be the best. For example, at 70W a single 3000mAh battery doesn’t come close to lasting me through a work day. Those who already run single cell mods know the deal. If you’re used to running dual cell mods at 80W or more, you may want to either adjust your vaping style by finding a smaller build that still hits the spot, or be cool with carrying around an extra battery.


Which brings me to the included coils. They’re surprisingly decent quality and do suit the RDA itself quite nicely although I found I liked them running at about 70W which as mentioned won’t do wonders for your battery life. A set of lower mass single core claptons running at 40-50W may have suited this setup a little better in my opinion. Still, it’s great they include some.


The included clear cap is okay but feels like a bit of a novelty to be honest. After the first puff you won’t be able to see your coils that well and the airflow is non adjustable. I could bet that 90% of users will try it once and pop it back in the box where it’ll stay. Like the coils though, it’s still cool they included it and personally I like extra things in the kit to play around with like this. Who knows, you might love it.


The mod itself has all the features you’d expect such as TC and normal wattage mode, with the addition of bypass and variable voltage. It also has some extra options to allow customisation of the nuts and bolts of how the mod operates such as standby time but honestly they’re not the most intuitive. Don’t throw the manual away, you’ll be needing it! For specifics, check out [Tony’s YouTube video](https://youtu.be/S4D0H8MXlD8). I quite like the handfeel and lightness of the mod, and personally I really like bare plastic with no paint finish to worry about scratching. The G10 panels on mine have a pleasant texture to them as well as looking classy. The only thing that gives me a little concern is the possibility of them being damaged in use and releasing some fibreglass fibres around where you’re inhaling. [Here’s a Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G10_(material)) on G10 if you’re interested.


I’ll do a run down of the Pulse X atomiser below and for the testing I’ll be showing what I found with the USB charge function, the low cell cut-off and standby current, and a dismantle with an opinion on the build quality and design. I haven’t tested the DC converter performance on this device as yet, let me know if you’d like to see it.


The results and data below should apply equally to the older Pulse 80W as the same board is used. Confirming that, the board in my 90W model is printed with “Vandy Chip 80W V1.0”.

&nbsp;

**The Pulse X RDA:**


It’s pretty decent, I dig it. The star of the show is the juice flow system and it works very well. Upon squonking, juice flows directly onto the coils which I think is great. No waiting for the cotton to wick up juice from the deck. New squonk users will probably be able to avoid dry hits more effectively with this system. It may also help to avoid over squonking as your coils will be the first place to get juice, as will the clever valve system which sucks back excess juice from the floor of the deck. It worked decently for me.


Building was easy, no worries there. The build deck looks goofy but works well. You’ll want to be bending your coils in super close to the middle block to get them right under the juice outlets. The one small quality gripe I have is with the threads on the screws - two of them were quite rough. They still worked though and would likely get better with use.


Airflow is very smooth and has a pleasant texture to it. Plenty of ability to adjust to your liking too.


Having tabs on the deck which correspond to a matching set on the barrel is a good feature to ensure you don’t have to mess around getting the airflow holes aligned with your coils. I reckon all RDA’s should have these.


O-rings are on the tight side but I’m cool with that. Better than falling off for sure. The top cap airflow adjustment won’t be going anywhere unless you really want it to.


Flavour for me with dessert style juices wasn’t shockingly great but wasn’t terrible either. It might be possible to get a bit more out of it with coil placement but you’re fairly limited as to how far you can move them without losing the functionality of the juice system.


Overall I think the Pulse X RSA is a pretty solid introduction to squonking for a new user.

**Rant time!**

Feel free to skip this long winded part if you’re just interested in the testing stuff! Let me preface this section by saying I mean absolutely no disrespect to Tony B and VandyVape. Good on you guys for making interesting new products. I’m a bit salty though! As always, feel free to let me know your opinion, if you disagree with mine, or want to otherwise discuss. 


Sooo… this is going to be a bit of a rant on something that bothers me. Which is, reviewers when explaining about the mod functions saying to only use USB charging “in a pinch” or to outright avoid it. That would be completely fine if there was a proper technical justification as to why on that specific device, but there normally isn’t. I’d much prefer what I’ve heard GrimmGreen say in a review - something like “here’s the USB port for charging and updates, but I prefer to charge all my batteries in an external charger.” Cool, I’m alright with that. It’s not saying it’s good or bad, just an opinion. Now since the Pulse X is Tony B’s device, I was interested to see how he would explain the USB charge function on the Pulse X mod. 


[On his YouTube video at 13:17](https://youtu.be/S4D0H8MXlD8?t=797) for this device - “In a *pinch*, you can charge with the mod but…” and then - “We even say in the manual to charge your batteries externally because an external charger is dedicated to that purpose and is **always** better for your safety and battery life” Heyyy, there it is. Well then.


Look, I have no doubts that Tony has our best interests and safety at heart and is trying to give good advice, but here we have the creator of a device telling us that there’s a feature on his device that you’re not supposed to use all the time. Does anyone else find this weird?


Tony doesn’t claim to be into the technical stuff (which is totally fine!), so I’d like to assume the statement above is motivated by wanting to be cautious (or as a CYA) rather than there actually being something wrong with the charge function. But what if we take that statement at face value? Is it admitting there is something they know is wrong with the charge function? Like, if you use it too much could it fail or be dangerous? Is the port too weak? In which ways exactly is an external charger better and safer? Which external charger are we comparing to here - a $5 Fasttech no-name-special or a GyrFalcon? There’s a massive difference between them! And how often is “in a pinch”??


I feel like if you’re going to provide a feature on a device, it should be capable of being used without an arbitrary limit. That goes for all mods in my opinion. If you’re openly saying your device can’t be trusted to handle the simple job of charging a single cell with around 5 watts of power, are we to trust it with firing the atomiser at 90W and other critical battery management tasks with cells capable of discharging 40A or more? If the argument for not being able to use it regularly is that the port will eventually break… why didn’t you use a stronger port then? If the charge function on this mod really is that bad, why should it even be there at all? What about the owners who don’t read the manual or watch his videos who may assume that it’s okay to use it as a daily method? I can’t help but feel that saying USB charging should only be used on this device “in a pinch” is just a bit of a cop out - either provide this function on your device and stand by it, or leave it off entirely.


Addressing the last part of that initial quote Tony’s video - “an external charger is dedicated to that purpose and is **always** better for your safety and battery life” - in my opinion this is **absolutely not true.** This is a **myth** that needs to be debunked. This gives rise to the false idea that you could go out and buy the cheapest external charger and be safe or even just “safer” by using it instead of the mod. Comparing mod USB charging (which already doesn’t make sense as they’re all different) to a known, tested, and quality external charger *may* well see the external charger come out as favorable, but I strongly disagree with “all external chargers are safer” as a blanket statement which is what is being implied. Referring to [this great resource](https://lygte-info.dk/info/roundCellChargerIndex%20UK.html) of charger tests, we can see that there are quite a few which do not perform well at all, and some that look downright dangerous. Some mains powered units even failed the basic voltage isolation tests. It’s worth noting that depending on your country and if your charger does not have the appropriate certifications, you may not even be covered by insurance if it fails and damages your house. I think if you’re going to recommend an external charger as a safer or better alternative to USB charging, you should be specifically referring to a known good and tested model or at least adding a simple prefix of *good quality* to imply that not just any model will do.

&nbsp;

**And another thing! (USB rant continues)**


Personally, I’m a bit tired of USB charging being the black sheep issue that no one wants to talk about or deal with. It gets swept under the rug in this fashion of “It’s there but don’t use it”. I reckon that’s BS and we deserve better. There are literally millions of devices around the world with lithium cells that only charge by USB - it’s not wrong for a user (and especially a new one) to want to use it. It is absolutely not a difficult task with today's electronics and contrary to popular belief with mods, **there is nothing inherently wrong with USB charging.** It also doesn’t make any sense to say that USB charging in general shouldn’t be used on any device as it totally depends on the design and quality of each individual device. It would be kind of like seeing a particular model of car breaking down often and saying “Whelp, all cars are unreliable, everyone should only ride the bus. You should know this already!” 


I think it’s time we stop avoiding the issue and push towards encouraging manufacturers to either give us a good reliable charge function that we can use if we choose to, or just not provide it at all if they’re not confident in doing so or won’t stand by it. That’s not to say there aren’t mods on the market that don’t already do a pretty decent job, and that’s where testing is needed. Hopefully I can help with that.


In my opinion there are overlooked benefits to be able to have a reliable and well performing charge option on board, such as a much lower chance of damaging wraps (remember these cells aren’t even supposed to be handled outside of a battery pack), lower cost / barrier of entry to switch to vaping, being able to charge on the go and not be tempted to grab a pack when stuck with dead batteries, and a lesser chance of mixing up cells that should stay together in a married set.


I’m in the process of writing an in-depth post on what I’ve found with USB charging on devices so far - including all the technical points like the operation and implementation I’ve seen, failure theories and analysis, history and why it has the current reputation, a comparison to external charging, and how I feel it could be improved. Please let me know if you’re interested. I’d also really appreciate your personal thoughts and experiences with USB charging in general. Worth testing and investigating? Waste of time and wish it would just go away? Let me know!

**Alright, I’m done! Onto the actual mod testing**

---

&nbsp;

**USB charging performance:**


[All charge graphs here.](https://imgur.com/a/ux0b8pe)


The Pulse X uses the very common and well performing 5056 charge controller IC which *should* be similar to using a good quality external charger. [Sample datasheet here.](http://file.yizimg.com/328625/2012112613030098.pdf) Other mods using the 5056 such as the Pico Squeeze display a very good charging behaviour. Something is not right on this Pulse X mod though. I don’t know if mine is abnormal, if they’re using a poor quality 5056, or there’s a design issue. The number “5056” by the way is a designator for that type and design of IC. Theoretically, all 5056’s should perform the same function but note that they can be produced by many different manufacturers and thus vary in quality.


This IC should be able to charge at up to 1A with quite an accurate maximum voltage. The spec for this IC is 4.20V +/-1% but I’ve found it to normally be even more accurate than that, often bang on 4.20V.


While the spec for the 5056 allows a maximum of 4.24V in the +1% tolerance, my Pulse X mod topped out at 4.276V, a bit over. This is most likely not a dangerous voltage but will probably cause some accelerated cell aging. Note that some runs of the Efest LUC V4 suffer from the same slight over voltage.


The 5056 IC in my unit also got abnormally hot - peaking at a toasty 110degC. At this temperature the IC itself is throttling the charging current in order to not damage itself. Note that the cell effectively won’t see any of this heat as it’s well isolated from the board. We can see this throttling in effect in the current graphs - there’s a peak of around 1A for a very short time at the start of the cycle while the IC is cool, then the current throttles right back to a little over 600mA before climbing again towards the end. The IC can charge at a progressively higher current as the cell voltage rises, due to the smaller difference between the USB voltage and the cell voltage. Effectively it doesn’t have to dissipate as much heat when these two levels are closer. Thermal design of the board might be a factor here although it’s hard to tell. [On the Pico Squeeze board](https://imgur.com/X0ckcIx) using the same IC, there is a large amount of copper area underneath the component which should help wick heat away. [Looking at the Pulse board](https://imgur.com/5PYXEmc) (the 5056 is in the lower left), there is very little.


I haven’t seen a 5056 get this hot or have to throttle current in any other mod. [These graphs](https://imgur.com/a/FDO2B) from the Pico Squeeze test show a steady regulated charging current through the first part of the cycle, as it should be.


The high operating temperature of the charge controller in the Pulse X mod tested may be responsible for the inaccuracy of the maximum voltage. Some performance characteristics of the IC change with temperature.


There’s still a proper charge cut-off once charging current has naturally reduced to around 75mA at the constant voltage phase which is a feature of this type of controller.


After cut-off though the board stays active and will be discharging the cell at 57mA while USB power is connected. When the cell voltage drops to around 4.15V, the charge circuit will kick back in to top it up. This will occur over and over after a cycle while the device is left plugged in - we can see this behaviour in the graphs. This means that the board is not capable of using the USB power for its own standby current, it must come from the cell. It also means the board does not go into deep sleep mode while USB voltage is present. Many other mods do this including the DNA 200 and 250, it’s not a huge deal but would be better if it didn’t. As always, it’s best to unplug after the charge cycle is finished.


Overall this is a strange outcome. The performance does not line up with what should occur with a 5056 type charge IC. Again, I can’t say one way or the other if I got a unit out of spec, low quality components are being used, or the board thermal design is not great. If VandyVape feel this result is not representative of their product, I’d be more than happy to test another unit and repost.


**USB charge function TL;DR:**
**A TL;DR is difficult for this one. The Pulse X mod has a 5056 charge controller which should perform similarly to a good quality external charger. Mine however performed poorly. It ran too hot (110degC peak) and the maximum charging voltage was slightly too high (4.276V). It should be charging at 1A but thermally throttles to around 600-700mA for a lot of the cycle.**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Low cell cut-off and standby current:**


Once the cell voltage drops to around 3.2V, the mod will not fire. Above this when firing, the mod will allow the cell to sag substantially lower but will reduce the power output. It’s a bit difficult to quantify as the actual throttled power output with a low cell will vary greatly depending on your particular cell and wattage setting. There would be a lower cell voltage under load limit which triggers the board to reduce power in order to not exceed it.


For an anecdotal example, with a resting cell voltage of 3.4-3.5V on a near new 5-leg 20700 and the mod set to 65W, I was noticing heavily throttled output. Many other mods will fire at the set wattage as long as the cell is above the cut-off.


I can do more technical digging into this upon request if you guys want to know more specifics.


Moving onto the standby current, there are some things to note here but it’s all good. Screen-on standby current is fairly high at 73.1mA, screen off active mode is a lot lower at 19.18mA, and full sleep mode is a super low 4.0uA. Bizarrely, the default active standby time is set at a massive 30 minutes. Effectively if you take a hit more than once per 30 minutes, your mod will never go into full sleep mode and will be constantly drawing at least 19mA. As we saw with the Aegis Legend, this can waste a substantial amount of battery power over a day. With the default 30min setting on the Pulse X mod, you’d waste around 230mAh over a 12 hour period if you were taking regular puffs. This is around 5-10% of your battery capacity depending of which model you’re using. 


Luckily, you can set this active standby time down as far as 2 minutes via the menu. I’m glad they put this in, I’d suggest every user to do this. You may find the first puff has a slightly longer delay from waking but I think it’s well worth it. I struggled to even see any delay when firing and watching the voltage output and personally I didn’t notice it in use.


**Low cell cut-off TL;DR:**

**Cut off is at a decent 3.2V. Standby current is fine but to save battery life change the standby time in settings back to 2 minutes from the ridiculous 30 minutes that is set by default. If you’re noticing weak hits well before the battery is empty, you may have better results with a higher CDR cell.**

&nbsp;

**Internal build quality, design and dismantle:**

[Here are the pics](https://imgur.com/a/2CpyMe6) of inside this device. The internals are easily accessible by removing the plastic panel on the back of the mod - it’s held on with 8 torx screws.


Keeping in mind what has happened with the Voopoo Drag in regards to juice ingress and the fact that the Pulse X mod is a squonk, I was interested to see how well protected this device was from spills and leaks.


The short answer is, not very. Or… at all. There are no seals whatsoever around the removable panel that covers the internals, around the buttons or screen and the board does not have a protective conformal coating. It’s entirely possible for juice to enter inside the mod from all of these areas. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if boards in Pulse mods start failing due to juice ingress.


As a squonk mod, I’ve got to assume it’s going to be subject to more juice spills and leaks that a normal non-squonk mod. I can almost guarantee the majority of squonk mods are going to at some point be subject to flooded atomisers and juice spills from removing, filling and replacing the bottle. It’s especially important that these devices protect the board when this happens.


Very disappointing design here and probably the most worrying thing I found about this device. If anyone has a Pulse 80W or 90W and has used it extensively, I’d be interested to see the insides if you are confident to take the panel off.


I can’t comment on how well the 510 itself is sealed, I’d need a lot more time with it to see evidence of leaking. 


The board itself apart from not having a conformal coating looked good. If anything, the power section looks overbuilt for the intended wattage. I’m not surprised that they increased the allowable wattage from 80W up to 90W. There are 4 MOSFET’s and one big inductor in the main voltage converter. Nothing to complain about with either the machine or hand soldering, all good. I’d hope the solder on the 510 wires near the squonk tube is lead-free although it shouldn’t ever come in direct contact with juice anyhow.


By design the main battery positive wire has ended up being super long - it travels from the contact all the way to the other end of the device and back up again to the board termination point. It has a much thinner jacket than the other wiring in the device which uses thicker silicone. They’ve had to do it this way to get from the contact to the board without adding extra thickness to the device by going straight across the cell. I feel like they could have done this better - a long wire gives extra voltage drop in the input circuit which is very undesirable in a single cell mod. I measured 0.04V drop just on this wire alone at 65W set, around 70W from the cell. This drop will be proportionally greater at a higher current level.


I noticed that the fire button contacts the screen ribbon cable when pressed which is not great.


The USB socket is the weakest type of arrangement of being mounted at a 90 degree to the board and only attached with 2 solder tags for mechanical relief. 


Minor issues with my device was the magnet on one of the doors falling out after 2 days, and the squonk tube being a little too short. No big deal but had to be mentioned.


**Quality TL;DR:**

**Zero protection from juice ingress, be very careful with spills. If you own either the Pulse 80W or 90W and know you’ve spilled a substantial amount of juice on it (especially around the inner panel with screws or the screen / buttons), I’d recommend having a look inside the device to check for ingress. Positive battery wire is overly long due to the design and results in a bit more voltage drop than necessary. Board looked decent quality and seems over built power-wise for 80-90W (good) but does not have a protective conformal coating.**

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Final TL;DR:**

**The almost complete lack of protection from juice ingress is a worry, and the wiring could be better thought out. I had some minor quality issues like a magnet falling out of the door and the squonk tube being a little too short. The USB charging function on mine was poor, although I’m not sure if my unit was out of spec.**

**On the upside, the Pulse X RDA is pretty decent and I liked the outside design and feel of the mod. The board looked well capable of handling 90W and apart from the USB function the mod itself performed decently well for me.**

t3_9sc7me,A beginner needs help deciding which dual battery mod to buy along with a tank :),"Hello everyone, i've been looking around and gathering as much info as possible since i'm still a noob in the whole vape scene. So i decided to make a list of mods what to buy (based on recommendations), can you guys share some insight what would be the best choice of these: https://i.imgur.com/gFTuaqv.png

Or if there's any other mod that you would recommend, i'm all ears. Also included Innokin Zenith there because i'm used to that MTL feel with cigarettes, i read it's a good choice for that purpose. 

I already have batteries and a charger so that's not a problem, do i need to buy coils and what else on top of liquids?

I just want the whole machine be as durable/leak resistant as possible and last a long time without any massive hassle. Later i might get into building as i figure out everything, i love messing around with this kind of stuff. 

All help is welcome, thanks in advance.",Mon Oct 29 04:23:41 PDT 2018,Semisti
t3_9sc655,Temp Control Annoyances,"My device has started doing this again, and often does with new coils, and wonder if I'm doing something wrong.

Often it starts temp control cutting out when clearly the temp is not remotely exceeding the limit. Was just standing outside in -3C weather with a device I hadn't yet used today and it cuts out for temperature limit after holding the button down for 0.3 seconds.

This is particularly common when I've recently replaced the coil. Is there something I should be doing? Is changing the coil confusing the system as to the resistance or something? I do the unlock resistance, fire it, then lock again but that never seems to make a difference.",Mon Oct 29 04:17:01 PDT 2018,CressCrowbits

t3_9sbsc0,How do you decide when to change coil if it doesn't taste burnt?,"I have just changed a few coils, and even though none of them tasted unpleasant or burnt, all tasted so much better after the change. I do try to keep a record of my refills and coil changes and some of them had been used 30+ times, whilst others had been switched out after only two fills, but were used so rarely that the coil had been in tank for six months or more.

t3_9sbld7,VapCell 21700 3750mah Batteries not lasting long,"I switched to mechanical mods in june (Kindbright Nato + Manta RTA at 0.3 ohms) and I'm still happy with that decision. With the new tube mod I got there, I also ordered four of these VapCells just to have an upgrade from my old VTC6 18650s (that I didn't intent to use in a mech anyway).

For the first couple of months I was very satisfied with the 21700s runtime. I'm quite the chain vaper and I could vape each battery for about 3-4 hours. But since a couple of days it seems that the batteries no longer last as long as they used to. I KNOW that batteries are wear items and therefore battery drain keeps increasing over time. But since a week or so, it doesn't take more than 1-2 hours (2 hours MAX) until tooting feels incredibly weak. At first I thought I'm imagining things, but when I put the battery in the charger, the battery really ran low in such a short period of time. The batteries are barely 4 months old, which I'd say is nothing. From the looks of it, they're not damaged at all, the wrapping is just fine, I never dropped them or anything. So why is this happening? Is this really normal behavior or are the batteries just crap? Shall I buy new ones from another company? Or did I even fall for counterfeits (link removed)?

t3_9sbea5,"With the FDA in the United States trying to limit vaping, I'd like to share some info on how vaping evolved in South Korea and where it currently is."," South Korea traditionally had a very high percentage of smokers among the population for decades for many reasons, but there is a single biggest factor.  
As many of you probably know, South Korea has a 2~3 years mandatory military service for every male citizen.  
Up until the early 2000s, the military handed out cigarettes as rations to every soldier regardless of the soldier being a smoker or not.  
Non-smoking soldiers would usually trade them with other smoking soldiers for various items, but many started to smoke themselves.  
And the government who were responsible for spreading nicotine addicts, started to raise the taxes on cigarettes on a regular basis.  
Most notably on 2014 when they more than doubled the taxes on cigarettes making the average cost of a pack of cigarette about $4 to 5$ with 80% of that price being various taxes.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
This was a calculated move from the government as previous raises on cigarette taxes proved that while the initial sales will decrease for a very short period of time, the sales always recover and they end up with more tax revenue since cigarette is an addiction not a leisure.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
However, this time the government missed a crucial factor which was the implementation of vaping and advances in electronic cigarettes.  
Within weeks following the tax raise, smokers were furious and everyone and their mother looked towards vaping as the alternative to being a fiend who gets their blood sucked by the government.  
  
For a while, there were no regulations other than the fact that you can't buy nicotine online which lead to numerous ""vape shops"" opening around every corner of cities.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
But I knew the government won't just stand by and watch their expected tax revenue flow into vaping shops so they started hitting back.  
The first wave was various questionable studies saying they found cancer enducing chemicals in electronic cigarettes and it was 10 times the amount from a conventional cigarette.  
This wasn't working so great since people who switched to vaping all felt better and they didn't want to go back to smoking cigarettes.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The next attack was taxes.  
They changed the law so that they could tax e-juice as cigarettes if it contained nicotine from tobacco and they went crazy on it.  
The amount of nicotine didn't matter and if a e-juice had any traces of nicotine, the entire bottle would get full cigarette tax which was about $1.5 per ml so about $45 for a 30ml bottle.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
This time vapors turned into obtaining pure nicotine and trying to DIY the e-juice because of the ridiculous taxes.  
People started importing pure nicotine from China and mixed them with non nicotine e-juice which were cheap and easy to buy online.  
They first started to limit the imports of nicotine but they needed a legitimate reason to do that especially to China who is a very important trade partner for South Korea.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Then the tradegy hit as many of you might have guessed.  
Yes, pure nicotine is EXTREMELY toxic and dangerous and it was only a matter of time until some accident happens.  
There was a murder using pure nicotine and a suicide with pure nicotine.  
South Korea doesn't see many murders so the story became viral overnight giving the public support to the government about banning nicotine.  
Shortly after, all pure nicotine became illegal to purchase, carry,or to sell both on and offline.  


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
But there were already a lot, I mean a lot of nicotine in the market that would last years so this time they went to the source.  
They made it so that all e-liquids that doesn't contain nicotine which were all freely sold online, would need to be tested as ""non-medical supplements"" from the administration.  
It was basically a global ban on all non nicotine e-liquids since the testing cost millions of dollars.  
At this point the only legal e-liquids in the country is the e-liquids that contain nicotine sold exclusively at offline shops with the crazy $45 tax per 30ml bottle.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Many people including myself thought this is the end of vaping in South Korea and were furious, but powerless since to every non nicotine addicts, a ban on anything relating the word ""cigarette or nicotine"" is a good thing.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
But the market hit back citing a parent law of the trade law which defines what a cigarette is in the eyes of the law and it said ""A product that is produced from leaves of tobacco to consume in forms of smoke, steam,.....etc....."" and said,  
""You can't tax our liquids if it isn't produced from tobacco leave because technically it's not a cigarette under law"".  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
This started the werid idea of ""Stem nicotine"" claiming that their nicotine is not from the tobacco leave but stems of tobacco which mean they can't be taxed as cigarette.  
It's mostly scam since it is very hard to prove that the nicotine in the e-liquid is actually from the leaves and not the stems.  
So right now most of the e-juice in Korea is labeled ""contains Stem nicotine"".  
They can still only be sold offline so the price is still quite high at around $30 to 40$ per 30ml, since the shops seem to have an agreement not to sell below that price even though they get the product for less than 10% of that price.  
Again, they are also profiting from addicts after all.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
This isn't the end.  
A company in USA claimed they have succesfully created a ""Tobacco free nicotine"" which means they didn't use any tobacco and created nicotine purely from chemicals.  
Their products are also untaxable under current law and they are even sold online since there's nothing tobacco about it to regulate it.  
I've been using it for a while now and I can safely say that it does cover the ""nicotine need"" your body has, but doesn't taste or feel nearly as good when vaping compared to regular nicotine.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The current strory is that the company that created the TFN(Tobacco Free Nicotine) is urging the South Korean government to bring the hammer down on the scam products so called ""Stem nicotine"" claiming it is almost impossible to extract enough nicotine from Stems to produce product at their price.  
While at the same time, the government is still trying to find ways to change the law so they can tax anything and everything that even remotely helps with the nicotine addiction.   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
The future of vaping is very dark here in South Korea as is in many countries with politics that makes my head spin in agony.  
One thing this does is that it fuels my desire to overcome my addiction to nicotine and become free of all the bullshit the industry and the government tries to pull on me for being an addict.  
But did I mention all non-nicotine e-liquid is basically banned?  lol.  
  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Thank you for reading and I hope things are better in your countries than mine.

t3_9s98mm,A big review of a little device: the Vapeccino MATE1,"Hello again! It's your friendly neighbourhood Canadian back with another pod review! This time I'm bringing you the Vapeccino MATE1. This is a cool little device; it's obviously going after the Juul fans, but it brings a much looser draw to the table and in my opinion far better (but still pod-level) flavour.

Full disclosure, I only used this little guy for a couple weeks but lost most interest in it once I figured out the pods really, really can't be rebuilt without more effort than I'm willing to put in. However, I feel I put its MTL pods through their paces in stock condition enough that I'm confident that I got a pretty good impression of this device, and I really liked it. The pods not being rebuildable or rewickable is just a deal-breaker for me.

And with that out of the way...

If you're not addicted to that tight pull the Juul offers, then I dare say this is a Juul replacement (not a killer because of that loose draw, but a good open pod alternative). It has that slick tap-to-view battery level indicator and the vibration function is really neat.

My initial impressions were pretty good. I got the pearl white, and the box came marked Special Edition, which was a nice perk. Grey and black were the first two colours offered and the only two I see on the official site. The box was surprisingly nice for such an inexpensive unit and I was actually happy with the presentation. The device itself is in all honesty gorgeous. The pearl white is actually pearlescent, but not in a gaudy way; it subtly shimmers if the light catches it but just looks sort of like a brushed finish otherwise.

It came with one MTL pod; I haven't tried the DTL as I had very little interest after hearing they were too airy, cool and loose. The MTL pod performed nicely. It wasn't perfect; rather loose, cool and airy, but the flavour was alright for a pod system. I got about 5-6 refills before the pod was kaput, and they're literally almost impossible to rebuild and not get horrible performance out of (not to mention cracking them open), so forget about that if you're looking for a rebuildable or rewickable pod.

However, where it came up really short was battery life. I got about 2-3 hours of chain vaping out of it before it was at around 30%, which is where I found it was getting too wispy. Major kudos go to Vapeccino for providing 2A charging, which means it can be charged from dead to full in 25 minutes. That's a pretty big deal to me because I really don't like waiting for my stuff to charge, so for it to take no longer than a smoke break to charge really is a nice selling point for me.

All in all, I'd say ""yes"" to getting this if you don't mind buying pods for it. They're not expensive and I took a point and a half each off for the weak battery life and the airy draw on the MTL pods (as the DTL ones are widely reported to be cooler and airier than the MTL ones, I feel a point and a half is fair); otherwise this little dude is pretty alright with me. I give the Vapeccino MATE1:

#7/10

#Adjusted to 5/10: see below

#EDIT:

It's come to my attention that the manufacturer's website has absolutely no regulation when it comes to reporting the actual specs on this thing. It says it has 2A charging and a 410mAh battery, but charging that ""410mAh battery"" takes 25 minutes. Which at 2A, should charge 820mAh, not 410mAh. So that means either the charge rate is misreported or the battery capacity is. I'm very leery of recommending a device when the manufacturer themselves can't even get the information right, so this thing now gets a thumbs down and a 5/10 from me; I feel misleading consumers about the specifications of a device is worth two points, as the 2A charging is literally one of the main things that sold me on it.

t3_9s92sj,I need a consensus on coil life,"

Now I have noticed people showing pictures of coils that look brand new and they claim to run 60-200ml through them. Now these coils look like they were just installed. 

Can I call BS on this?
Does anyone actually get coils to run this long?

Over my years of vaping I have extensively used rebuildables. Now one thing I have strived for was a coil that had an extraordinary lifespan in between rewicking.

Now it didn’t take me long to discover TC and spaced builds and I was able to push my coils to the 60-70ml mark. (Single coil) I have noted that my coils look junky within 20ml, there is visible black junk and a slight discoloration of my cotton but the taste doesn’t go until much later.

t3_9s7cqs,[Review] Geekvape Ammit MTL RTA - A niche filled perfectly,"**Background:** This is my first review of a vaping device, I’ve been vaping for a few months but have years of experience dealing with my mother’s equipment--namely the Nautilus line so I know MTL gear quite well. This is my second rebuildable behind the Crius II single coil.

I was craving a MTL setup for smaller cloud hits, something to peck away at on breaks at work, something very similar to the Nautilus 2 in overall design. I’m not disappointed.

[Pics of the tank](https://imgur.com/a/S4wLXjF)

**Design:** The main selling point of this tank is that it’s a top-air flow, bottom feeding MTL tank. At 24mm, the tank feels hefty and well built but without feeling overly large or unwieldy. All the parts feel dense as none of the machining is made with thinner materials (unlike the top cap on the Crius II). For a 4ml juice capacity, the tank feels compact versus other tanks which can be seem tall for the same amount. The angled top is one of my favorite design elements as it leaves a good place for your lips and cheeks to rest (warning, can get warm but not hot with chain-vaping). I got the blue color which surprisingly turned out more of a bright navy rather than the bright true-blue in most pics. It’s a handsome device. Machining and threading is all good, but not amazing.

Top screw off juice fill is nice, and the slots are large enough for most tips. I just wish it used an easier locking mechanism like Hastur RTA. The bottom of the tank recesses into the base a bit, so you may need to turn it sideways to check for the last remains of juice. You can run this tank nearly dry.

The top airflow is a great feature as this tank doesn’t leak at all and from what I’ve ran it as, it doesn’t decrease flavor in the slightest with the bottom-airflow. 

The included 3mm and 2mm inner-diameter mouthpieces are good, but I stick to the 3mm piece as I run in-between the air flow holes most of the time. The rest of the kit includes extra glass and o-rings and screws.
 
**Building:** The build deck is small and the tank came with a 3mm round coil. But doesn’t stop you from fitting a small 5 wrap 3mm clapton in it. Coiling can be difficult. The inner-diameter of the posts will stop thicker coils from getting through so be careful. 

Wicking is the biggest issue with this tank, although not as difficult as some other tanks I believe. The wick holes are rather small with tiny holes in the bottom for juice to flow in, but strangely deep for the deck so you need to put very little cotton down through them to wick properly. I tend to cut half the cotton from the coil then tear some away until I have almost nothing before dropping it in. Too much cotton, it won’t wick at all. Too little and you’ll flood which tends to be quite bad, but you need to go light for it to wick correctly. I tend to leave a good amount of cotton besides the coil for reserve juice so it doesn't run dry.

**Airflow:** This tank has a five-hole airflow system with a single selector hole so you can choose any single hole to draw through. Nice system. It runs best between medium to tight airflow since opening it past the third hole and more loses flavor and make the air turbulent. You can do restrictive lung hits with the medium settings, but this is better as a mouth-to-lung tank for sure. Couldn’t tell you if the “3D” bottom airflow is the bee’s knees, but it certainly works well to produce flavor.

**Flavor:** The flavor out of this is fantastic when coiled and wicked right. I do feel as if the restrictive chimney can reduce some flavor and of course the reduction in air as a MTL tank means there’s not a massive impact of flavor, but strong flavor all the same. Again, flavor comes out better with medium to tight airflow settings as the tank likes to run more restrictive. I will note that chain-vaping can leave some residual burned juice near the top and once welled up can give an off taste. Just clean the tank after a while and you’re good. 

**Additional stuff:** I got this tank off Heavengifts with my own money upon discovering, stacked coupons and paid $20 and very happy paying that with shipping. For the $30-35 it’s running, I think it’s a great deal. I don’t believe it’s available outside of China of the time of this review, but have spoken with Elementvape and they stated they’d be carrying it soon. 

**Overall:** The whole design and features this tanks provides fulfills a niche needed in the MTL market. Top air intake, bottom feeding with a large juice capacity in a compact 24mm design. It’s a homerun tank for those looking for this exact setup.

t3_9s79nt,Swedish Vaper Hive / Dinky squonk kit - A review from the Darkcide,"Mech disclaimer: This review is for a mechanical device. Please make sure you are familiar with Ohm's Laws before using a mech. Know your batteries specifications and always build within their limits. Check your battery wraps to ensure that there are no rips or tears and if there are immediately rewrap the battery. Refer to the device's documentation for proper battery orientation. When using a hybrid make sure the atomizer's center pin protrudes far enough to prevent a short. Always build on a 521 tab or check on a regulated mod first to not only check resistance but to make sure that you don't have any problems that may lead to a short such as your coils touching your cap. Above all remember when using a mech its only safety features are you and your brain. 


Today I'll be presenting the Hive squonk and Dinky RDA kit from Swedish Vaper. It's a single 18650 mechanical squonker paired with a 17mm single coil RDA. This device was provided by Heaven Gifts for purpose of review but that will not affect my ability to provide a 100% honest review. The kit is available from Heaven Gifts for $59.90  or can be found at many popular retailers. The kit is available in either a Nightwasp (Black) frame with Milk (White) and Sting (Yellow) buttons and doors or a Honey (Ultem looking) frame with Nightwasp and Honey buttons and doors which I'll be reviewing. The Dinky is available outside of the kit in red, stainless, black which is included with the Nighwasp kit, and gunmetal which is included in the Honey kit. 

[Manufacturer's promotional materials](https://imgur.com/a/A8UKbG3)

The kit comes in a small square flat black box with a gloss black honeycomb pattern covering the entire surface except for the white slide out panel on the right side. The top has the kit's name and designer. The bottom panel contains the same info as the top with the addition of ""Incubated by DeepinMaker"". I don't know who DeepinMaker is but good job! The top panel lists the kit's contents along with showing the two available color options. There's a hexagon shaped checkbox next to all of them to let you know what the box contains. The left panel has the name and designer again plus an additional barcode sticker which has the kit color on it. The right panel is entirely white with a black fabric loop to assist in sliding it out. Flipping it over you'll once again be greeted by the name and designer but it additionally has the Swedish Vaper logo, some trademark info, and contact info.

[Packaging photos](https://imgur.com/a/St3OHe6)

Inside of the box you'll find the Hive with the Nightwasp door and button preinstalled. The Honey panel is below the device in a plastic bag and the matching button sits in a cutout to the right of the device. The white squonk bottle is already attached to the Hive and and the black is included in the battery tray. There are also cutouts that the Dinky and drip tip sit in. As expected being a squonk kit the Dinky comes with the squonk pin preinstalled. Below the foam you'll find the instructions sheet and goodies bag. Swedish Vaper gets special props for the instructions sheet. I highly recommend that you read it even if you feel that you don't need to because it's humorously well written. The goodies bag contains:

* An Allen wrench
* An extra set of O-rings
* A solid center pin for the Dinky if want to use it on a non-squonk device
* An extra set of post screws
* Probably the thickest Japanese cotton pad that I've ever seen
* Two 26GA 2.5mm ID Kanthal coils

[Inside on the box](https://imgur.com/a/oUUk3Iz)

The Hive is small, lightweight, stylish polycarbonate squonker. The corners are well rounded and comfortable. The entire device has overall frosted feel and appearance to it. There's honeycombing on the front panel below the hexagon shaped fire button. The fire button has a stylized h in the center. The battery door is mostly a honeycomb pattern with a large teardrop shaped hole for squeezing your bottle. There are two magnets molded into it. One attaches to a post within the device and the other attaches to the battery. Both of the included battery doors fit exceptionally well with no play what so ever. There are slightly visible injection molding marks inside of the doors. The side opposite the fire button has a glassy looking Hive written vertically in it with a few hexagons thrown in to carry on the theme. The back of the Hive features a large hexagon with Swedish Vaper at the bottom. The spring loaded Stealthvape Source SQ 510 sits at the top slightly upraised enough to prevent atomizer damage yet not high enough to create a visible gap between the device and atomizer. The Hive will fit up to a 24mm atomizer without overhang. The bottom bears the CE logo and the symbol warning you not to throw your device in the trash along with the text ""Nothing to see here. Really? Still reading? Ok then...Vape on!"". The bottom text is a funny little touch that I enjoyed.

[Device photos](https://imgur.com/a/FuR0vtM)

The inside of the device is smooth but as with the doors there are slightly visible injection molding marks. There are negative and positive marks on the battery side. I know battery rips are a worry on a lot of these little mechanical squonkers but this one seems to be designed well enough to prevent that. There's a small bump for the negative side on the top contact and the bottom is presses into a formed piece on the contact bar. There is zero play with the battery in place, it fits nice and tight. There's a battery strap to assist removal. The magnet for the door sits at the top of the separator between the battery and squonk bottle. There are two little tabs to hold the contact bar tight to the front of the device. The contact bar itself is held in by a little tab in the bottom that sits in a spot molded into the frame. It can be removed for cleaning or to change the fire button with a little gentle prying at the bottom. It's formed nicely and makes very solid contact with the 510 connector. Throw has a good amount of resistance and is springy. The button has the perfect amount of height that it always sits beyond the device and never recesses into the Hive while firing. I wish I could tell you what the contacts are plated with. It mentions plated contacts on the box but there's no mention of what that plating is. I scratch tested the contact bar so I can tell you that it has copper internals below the plating but your guess is as good as mine.

[Inside photos](https://imgur.com/a/TObbYxj)

The Hive's 510 connector has a pretty cool locking feature. At the bottom there is a rotating plastic ring. In the right position it is fully open and allows the bar to make contact with the 510 firing the device. If you grab the little tab and slide it to the left it rotates into a position that no longer allows the bar to make contact and fire. It's a simple idea that works really well.

[Contact and lock photos](https://imgur.com/a/Cr2f4ee)

The included squonk bottles are the super soft silicon kind. Oddly enough they feature Arctic Dolphin branding but I guess that makes sense from a production standpoint. Reduce your cost by using others off the shelf items rather than manufacturing your own. They both hold 7ml of juice. The black one is smoked pretty dark so depending on the lighting it may be hard to see your current juice level. Both have a decent size round opening. The bottoms of the tubes were flat when I received them which leads to a shitty squonking experience so I had to cut an angle in the tubing.

[Squonk bottle photos](https://imgur.com/a/jLeHovC)

The Dinky is a flavorful little 17mm dual post single coil RDA. It's a standard three piece deck, barrel, cap design. The cap can be used as either a chuff cap or it has a 510 drip tip opening. The cap and included drip tip are made of PEL. What PEL is beats the hell out of me but it seems to stand up to heat well. I've seriously never heard of this plastic type before. The rest of it is stainless. The deck, posts, and screws are all gold plated. The outside of the barrel feels cerakoted. The barrel has three small holes for taking in air on one side and the opposite side has Dinky written vertically in a funky late 60s style font. The cap features two different airflow options. One side has a large rectangular cutout which allows you to shut off airflow one hole at a time and the other has three matching holes that equally shut off the airflow across them all. It has a pretty large juice well relative to its size making over squonking hard but not impossible. If you're using it without the tip it's easy to see the deck and wick if you're one of those people that likes to have a visual check of your squonking activities. The center pin doesn't protrude very far so this one is a no go on a hybrid. Overall machining is excellent and everything fits together properly, tightly, and leak free. 

[Atomizer photos](https://imgur.com/a/CGMdA2q)

The Dinky is advertised as being able to go from DTL to MTL by adding the drip tip. That's not the case. However they didn't lie and it is capable of both. The drip tip doesn't seem to change much in the way of airflow honestly. To get it MTL not only do you need to add the tip but put the cap on the three hole side and close the holes down to practically fully closed. Then you can get a really nice MTL vape. DTL on this even fully open is restricted DTL. The design of the atomizer leads to incredible flavor no matter how you use it.

Building on this deck is a pleasure. Just leave your coil on the jig, pop the leads through the holes, secure, and trim. There's plenty of room between the posts and barrel so as long as your flush cutters are good and cut clean there's no reason not to cut the coil in place. There's not much to say about the included coils being basic round wire contact coils. The same can be said about the included cotton. After trimming and dry burning they came out to .6Ω. The cotton was clean tasting and wicked well. All of the publicity material mentions it is capable of fitting 3.5mm ID coils and they're not wrong to some extent. They don't factor in the size of the coil itself. The post holes are a good size but you're not going to be fitting huge thick flat claptons or quad core fused claptons in there. The atomizer is obviously not intended for that though and you should probably feel bad for contemplating it. I'd say this kit is more intended for higher resistance / lower wattage vaping. For example I wrapped a 316L 30x2+38 fused clapton with a 3.5mm ID which read .68Ω.

[Completed kit](https://imgur.com/a/W8XhiUH)

This is one of those reviews I'm going to sound like a shill on because I enjoy it so much. If you're looking for a small pocketable squonk kit this may be the one for you. It's very lightweight and compact not being much larger than the 18650 and bottle themselves. The locking mechanism will prevent it from accidentally firing in your pocket. If you're a MTL vaper looking for a mechanical equivalent to something like the VV Simple EX kit this may be the right one for you. There aren't many squonk kits out there marketed to MTL vapers and even though the Dinky isn't exclusively MTL it's no slouch. If you're just looking for an affordable aesthetically pleasing mechanical squonk kit this may be the one for you. The Hive and Dinky are beautiful. The fit and finish are top notch. If it weren't for some things like the injection molding marks and knowing it's polycarb you'd swear you're holding a high end device. The use of outside sourced parts like the 510 connector and squonk bottles only adds to that appeal. I love the ability to mix and match the included components to customize or change the look as well. 

This is definitely a flavor chaser rather than a cloud chaser kit. If you're looking to run large, hot, low resistance builds or wide open DTL look elsewhere. While you could build and fit low resistance coils I'd be afraid of the effects of the heat. Not only with my lips being so close to a hot tiny chamber but to the plastic itself. It does a good job keeping up with anything I've put on it with no excessive heat or any melting but I haven't built anything for it below .5Ω. I really wish they would have listed what the contact plating material is. I know it's copper underneath but it still kind of bothers me on a mech when I'm unsure of the materials and plating. It's probably not the hardest hitting mechanical device on the market but it doesn't seem like it's meant to be. 

Thanks to Heaven Gifts for sending me this device for review! And a special thanks to Swedish Vaper for helping to make it possible!",Sun Oct 28 15:10:47 PDT 2018,Darkcide666

t3_9s6ygs,Smok X-priv RDA issues,"Hello All,

I recently bought a Smok X-Priv and a Vandy Vape Lit RDA to go with it. I've been trying to test out the RDA on the mod, but every time I try to select my new atomizer it does something weird. Essentially, I rolled a couple of coils at 0.8 ohms and set them both on the deck of the RDA to get a resistance of around 0.4 ohms and when I press the fire button it asks me to select either the resistance of the new atomizer or the old atomizer. I select the new resistance which is right around 0.4 and let it stay there until the screen goes back to the main wattage mode display and sure enough the ohms on this screen read 0.000. 

At this point I've tried rolling new coils or only having one on the deck at a time but nothing works. The mod will recognize the resistances as values close to what I intended them to be, but it will always show up as 0.000 on the main screen. 

I've checked the 510 connector with another atomizer that came with the mod and it works great, but right when i switch to my RDA it goes back to the same problem. I've been checking the screws on the RDA and they're tightly connected so i'm not sure where to go next.

The main reason I'm so confused is that the mod seems to be reading the resistances fine when it's asking if I'm using a new or old atomizer, but then it doesn't work on the main screen. Has anyone ever had this happen to them before?",Sun Oct 28 14:31:47 PDT 2018,richardsonian

t3_9s6i4w,so you’re interested in MTL vaping episode 6: I feel like I’ve forgotten something,"Hey hey hey everyone!! /u/AnxietyAttack2013 here again! Today we’ve got someth...

**WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TALK ABOUT RDAS?**

Ahh yeah, I knew I was forgetting something!! Okay, scratch whatever I was going to talk about! We’ll put that on hold for a bit. Today we’re gonna get a bit into MTL RDAs!! 

So I’ll be honest, I’m not much of an RDA guy. I prefer my RTAs and I’ve never hid that. That said, I’ve recently gotten some hands on experience with some MTL RDAs and have slowly gotten back into using them so i guess now is as good a time as any to get into things.

**yeah I’ve noticed you mainly talk about tanks. Why is that when squonking is a thing?**

Personally I got sick of dripping. Believe it or not I was actually once a cloud chaser once. I wanted better performance than my cartomizers and vivi novas were giving me and I thought maybe cloud chasing would do that. And I tried to get into it. I had a dark horse RDA, a Kennedy, and a drilled out Enigma RDA and would rock those on mech mods or my Hexohm v2 all day every day. But I was going through so much juice and I was pretty sick of the huge clouds with very little flavor. But I thought MTL was lame at that point and dead. That all changed when I drunkenly ordered a Provari P3 and a Kayfun v4 (and killed my entire vaping budget for about 3 months). And that’s when I rediscovered my love for MTL vaping. I didn’t go back to RDAs because I was so over cloud chasing and would always associate RDAs with that even though there were great flavor RDAs back then like the Nofear and the Origen. 

I did have a brief stint of squonking a few years back with the reo but I felt it was a gimmick back then and didn’t really fall into it like I did with MTL RTAs. 

But that’s changed. With better regulated squonkers and inexpensive BF MTL RDAs, squonking is something I’ve actually enjoyed again. 

**ive suddenly forgotten what squonking is. Is that some kinda sex thing?**

No my imaginary companion. It is most certainly not! To get into what that is though, we’re gonna have to go back in time a little bit.

**oh no!! Grab a drink everyone. I think he’s gonna ramble on about the good old days again...**

So squonking isn’t anything new. Adding a larger juice capacity to tanks and atomizers is something we’ve been doing for ages now. Cartomizers for instance were great but did not last many people a long time. Cartotanks were a thing but you had to punch the cartomizers so juice could travel into them. And RDAs were cool but you had to redrip every few drags. There had to be a better way. 

That’s where bottom feeding came in. Someone thought “there has to be a better way”. So why not drill out the 510 pin of the atomizer and have the juice come up through that? 

But how would the juice get there? Well, toss a bottle inside the mod and have it flow into the atty from a hose through the 510 pin. 

Squonking comes from the “squonk” sound the bottle makes when you squonk it. 

**huh...that wasn’t nearly as bad as the last time you started going all “vaping historian” on me. I mean, that was cool and all but what does that have to do with MTL vaping?**

Well, a few things really. First, RDAs were originally MTL focused as were the first BF RDAs. Second, with squonking has brought on a whole new wave of MTL BF RDAs for us!! 

Many people think of RDAs as cloud chasing DL attys but there is more to them than that. RDAs can often provide better flavor than RTAs. While this is a generalization, it holds up fairly well. So it would make sense for MTL RDAs to be a thing. And boy howdy do they exist. 

**so what kind of MTL RDAs are currently out there?**

There are quite a few out there right now. From ones I can comment on, there is the Etna from Digiflavor, the 1928 from Cthulhu Mods, the Ammit from Geekvape, and the Reaper from Boomstick. And that’s just what I have experience with! There’s also the galaxy from vapefly, the Berserker from vandyvape, and so many others. 

With the resurgence of MTL, there cake a resurgence of MTL RDAs and there are more coming out im sure. 

And there are always older MTL RDAs too such as the nofear, the chalice, and more. Just because they are older doesn’t mean they aren’t good. 

**but what about builds? I can’t just throw in a fused clapton like I do with my DL RDAs, right? How do I build a MTL RDA?**

Well...you sorta can do that actually. But not the huge fused claptons you’re used to. Smaller build such as 28gax2 core and 34ga shell should be fine. Another build im a fan of is 24ga 6 wrap with a 3mm inner diameter. A lot of modern MTL RDAs can work with these larger builds. That said, you can still do simpler, smaller, more traditional, builds in these. 28ga or 26ga 6 wrap 3mm ID are usually good.

In my experience, the more modern builds will come out to around 0.55-0.63 ohms and are good up to 25 watts. The more traditional builds will be good up to 15 watts. But this is just my experience. Your mileage will vary. 

**so why should I go with an RDA over an RTA? What are the advantages?**

Well...it’s really down to personal preference. RTAs are convenient for sure. But with squonking being a thing again, you don’t have to worry as much. With squonking you have to worry about the bottle leaking and over squonking but no more than you would your tank flooding or leaking usually. You do get a greater juice capacity with squonking usually over an RTA though. And you don’t have to worry about your wicking nearly as much as you do with an RTA. 

RTAs are definitely more convenient than dripping though. You’ll be carrying a bottle around which isn’t always convenient. With an RTA, you have the juice right there in the tank. 

But there are some advantages. They are often smaller than RTAs. And the flavor can sometimes be better. You do get a warmer vape out of an RDA usually since there is less space for it to travel so less time for it to cool off. And when squonking, you often have a larger capacity compared to a tank. 

But in the end it is all down to personal preference. I wouldn’t say one is better than the other. There is a time and a place for each. Dripping is great when you’re testing out flavors. Squonking is great when you’re on the go. And RTAs are great when you’re unable to focus on squonking. Of course this isn’t 100% accurate for every person and taste is subjective. 

**of course I wouldn’t get a real answer from you...so which do you prefer?**

As much as I love squonking and acknowledge that it can be more convenient, I’m still more of an RTA kinda guy. Just something about them works for me. Nothing against RDAs, and I love squonking, but a well built RTA is just more enjoyable to me. 

But that is just me. You can definitely get some amazing flavor and nice MTL draws out of some MTL RDAs and they are definitely worth looking into. Especially ones that are bottom feeding as we are seeing more and more regulated squonk mods hit the market. With the resurgence of both squonking and MTL vaping hitting us at the same time, there are so many different products out there to fit everyone’s needs.

**INTRODUCTION**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello everyone Pizza Dave here, delivering a review of the Skynet and Skynet Pro Sub-Ohm tanks by Augvape. These tanks seem to be hitting the market under the radar a bit, and I contribute that to the fact that they are coming from a company commonly known for rebuildable atomizers. These two tanks are jumping into the market to compete with the wildly popular mesh-coiled tank category. Let’s see how Augvape faired in their attempt to compete, and as always, I will give you my final thoughts down at the bottom.

DISCLAIMER: This rda was sent to me by Augvape for review

**COIL HEADS** 

Both the Skynet and Skynet Pro come with mesh coil heads. Augvape must have done their research because both have some of the best flavor and coil life I have experienced to date. The regular Skynet coils are compatible with Horizontech Falcon coils heads, so it adds an option down the road when looking for replacements. 

The Skynet Pro coils heads are MUCH larger and are more like that Freemax Mesh pro size. I haven’t been able to do a test fit of these coils, but they look very closely, and I am confident that Mesh Pro coils will be a solid replacement if needed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**AIR FLOW AND REFILLING**

Both tanks have an abundance of air flow. I ran them around 2/3 open and they performed great for me right at that set point. The air flow is typical of sub-ohm tanks. A bit airy, a bit turbulence, but not awful. At first the air flow adjustment on both was way too tight, but after some use (and liquid lubrication) they loosened up and move more freely. Both tanks utilize threaded removable top caps for refilling. There are no gimmicky flip tops, or slide tops and I am thankful for that. It seems that many are doing slide tops as of late, but they aren’t well executed, and I am seeing reports of several opening in people’s pockets. I had a coworker get a pocket full of liquid last week as his Fireluke Mesh Pro slid open and dumped the entire tank.

&#x200B;

**HOW THE SKYNET VAPES**

The little brother of this pairing is one of those middle range tanks for power. I ran mine around 65 watts with the supplied .15-ohm single coil head and the vapor and flavor that these Augvape coil heads produce is amazing. I have held my Horizontech Falcon on the top of the mesh-tank pedestal, but now it shares that spot with the Skynet. It makes sense, since the coil heads between these two are interchangeable and all. One big pro for Augvape with their coil heads is the life. I went through 50mls of liquid before getting the slightest reduction in flavor. I also started to notice a little bit of liquid seeping into the air flow. This is hands down the best coil life I have tested on ANY type of sub-ohm coil. 

&#x200B;

**HOW THE SKYNET PRO VAPES**

This tank doesn’t mess around. It is placed in that higher wattage market and is meant to be ran in that 100w realm. I ran the triple-mesh coil on this one at 95 watts, and that’s when it came alive and started to billow the dense clouds and flavor I anticipated by looking at the heads.  Just like the original Skynet, the Pro puts out some amazing flavor and is hands down the closest thing I have tasted to some of my best builds on an RDA. It does come at a cost though. The required power eats up battery life on a mod and it goes through e-liquid at an incredible rate. I had to refill this puppy a couple of times throughout just one work day. One big pro is how long these coils last. I started off with a bottle that had 40mls in it. I figured it was a good amount for testing as I’ve never had a head last much beyond that. However, this one cruised past that point, and I had to go buy more of that same liquid. Once I hit 60mls, it started to leak a bit in to the air flow, but the flavor was strong. I went all the way to 75mls of liquid before I noticed a steep drop off in flavor. The coils don’t even look that bad! Kudos to Augvape and their coils.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Both the Skynet and the Skynet Pro tanks are great entries into the Mesh-coiled sub-ohm tank market. The Skynet fits right in that Fireluke mesh, Horizontech Falcon world, while the Skynet Pro is out here to contend with the Fireluke Mesh Pro and others in that size. They are constructed well and the fitment of everything is nice and smooth. I never had issues removing glass or getting anything back together. The coil heads are great, and available locally thanks to compatibility with other brands. The only complaints that I really have with these tanks are cosmetic. I think the regular Skynet looks decent, but with the lack of colors and a boring drip tip, they just don’t stand out in the market they are in. The Skynet Pro has a ribbed looked to it, and I feel that it looks very dated and is not eye catching in any way. The grooves also catch a lot of debris from hands and pockets and are only good for grip. Both are function over fashion, but how they function is top notch. These are easily the best mesh-coiled tanks I have used to date and have the best coils life/performance out there.

 

**OVEN TEST**

If this rda were to accidentally go into the pizza oven would I go out and get another? Until something better comes out, these will be my go-to Mesh-coiled tanks.

REVIEW CRITERIA: I use each item extensively for about two weeks to ensure I have collected enough data to adequately write a review. I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used all products enough to give an educated review. The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying them and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \*\*\*\*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.",Sun Oct 28 09:02:49 PDT 2018,pizzadave80

t3_9s3l7y,A question about using my mech mods,"Hello all,

I am not new to vaping, but I am new to mechs

I have the pulse bf mech, and have a nice tube mech in the mail.  

So with my pulse at first, I just could not get a satisfying, hard enough hit using the coils I would buy ( normal clapton prebuilt stuff). They would take forever to get hot

For Now I have found a work around for me... basically I bought some wire and made myself some mini coils. These things are tiny, but I’ll be damned... they give me a powerful draw.  They are safe resistance wise, although somewhat low ohm.  I do use ohms law and a resistance tester.  And for what it’s worth I never do anything close to chain vaping.  
Now I know that there must be something I haven’t figured out.   

So my questions... 

How can I get or make Non mini coils, and still get a good hit on a mech? 

Is it just that my pulse is weak thanks to voltage drop, which I’ve heard is a problem with this mod?

Would I have to go with borderline dangerously low resistance in order to use bigger coils and get a nice warm duel coil hit? My biggest priority is being safe, but I have noticed that videos online with “professionals” are building lower than what ohms law tells me is safe, and they just kind of rationalize it away. 

I’m guessing there are coils or a nice wire out there that I just haven’t found yet???...

By the way my tiny coils were at  .17 ohm

t3_9s385l,"New Mod, suggestions?","Hey there.

I'm using my Smok Alien for a long time now. It was fine when I was a total newbie to anything higher than 60W, but I have *some* issues with it. The biggest being the TC mode, which doesn't seem to be accurate at all. I'm constantly changing the TCR when I change the coil to another one which is just annoying. And I think I read some comments from ppl that Smok just doesn't get it right with the TC mode. This is why I feel this mod just isn't all that great. (And please correct me if I'm wrong here. I don't need a new mod, I just feel that it isn't great. Tell me if it is and what I'm doing wrong.)

For me there is no other way to vape but in TC mode with SS coils. And that's basically what I want: A mod that get's the TC mode just right without the need to fine tune it preferably, and of course SS setting in TC mode. It should be a two battery mod, wattage doesn't matter too much. I usually fire at around 90W and since 2 battery mods usually go up above 100W, I don't care too much about the maximum wattage as I'm not planning to go any higher any time soon.

I'm somewhat on a budget and don't want to invest too much money, but I do want a good quality mod. I'd say around 100€ maybe. If that is enough.

So, do you have any suggestions? I'll appreciate any of them. =)

I managed to break the tank yesterday (not just the glass) so I need a new one, but what I had is unavailable nearby.
I would be happy with some recommendations what I could use, preferably 4-5 ml to last through the day and around the same experience I had. Maybe a bit more cloud, but it's not that important.

Second, I managed to convince my sister to give up smoking for vaping, but I need to find her a starter kit which is good enough to convince her, but smaller than my current kangertech platinum. She wants something which is one cylinder shape. I found: iJust ECM, Kangertech Evod PRO V2 and eleaf iJust S.

t3_9s28j7,Is underage vaping a problem where you live?,"I'm a 21 year old male living in Germany, and I've been vaping since I was 19. I've left high school around then, and recently met some of my younger schoolmates on a party. All of them are underage (some 16, some 17).

They started smoking some time ago, and most of them also acquired a mod and started vaping on the side. I've spoken to them about it, and they said they only vape in order to save money because cigs get expensive over time.

Basically, they don't care how their nicotine is delivered, as long as it is delivered to their body. They don't care about flavors, even though they like certain ones. They also don't care about health aspects, it's just cheaper for them.

Now of course that's not a representative situation (HS in a bad part of town, etc) however there are a few issues I see with this.

- Underage vaping is represented by the media as a huge problem and that it'd be because of marketing and flavors

- We need a better age control system for ordering online (at least speaking for Germany)

Now don't get me wrong, I'd rather have those kids vape than smoke. But still with these examples, I think the issue is hugely overblown by the media (at least in Germany). These kids are a very small percentile, and if they weren't able to get their hands on gear, they'd just smoke.

t3_9s22j6,"I'm trying to find a purple/gold mod, and I'm coming up short.","Long story short, I finally got into RDAs with a Dead Rabbit. When I went to look for a second similar RDA I stumbled onto Heathen's review of the Aequitas RDA. 

In that review he showed a purple stab wood/gold asMODus with the gold Aequitas. I really want that combo, but I can't justify paying that much for a box mod. I saw the matte gold Dotmod and that would also look good, but without the kind of swirled purple it's not quite what I want. Plus I can't justify paying for that either. I know that VooPoo has a purple resin/gold Drag. It looks great and I like the price, but I'd rather not buy one of their mods.

t3_9s1taz,"Bench Test Results, Early Samples: Molicel P42A 45A 4000mAh 21700...great 30A battery, beats Samsung 40T","Bottom Line: Moli and NPE sent me several of these cells for testing and my thoughts about their performance. This is just a sneak peek at what’s coming, they hope to ship them to the rewrapping companies by the first quarter of 2019. I will retest them when they start shipping to the rewrappers. Some MIGHT be available before the end of the year though.

As of now, Moli won’t be making this cell directly available to us in its original wrapper due to existing agreements.

This is a great performing 21700 which hits harder and runs for longer than the Samsung 40T. It even competes with the Samsung 30T at 30A. The 30T hits harder for about the first third of the discharge but then the P42A holds its voltage up better and hits harder for the rest of the discharge.

If you use a mech and you change cells early then the 30T is the better choice because it hits harder at the start. But if you run your cells down to 3.5V-3.6V (when put on the charger), and wanted a slightly more consistent vape that could run for longer, then the P42A is probably worth trying. 

The datasheet lists 45A as the max continuous current rating but notes that cycle life is reduced at high current levels. Running this cell continuously at 45A gets it much too hot for that to be a continuous current rating we can use for comparing to other cells.

The datasheet lists the minimum capacity at 4000mAh. The four P42A’s I tested delivered 4168mAh - 4182mAh at 800mA (0.2C) down to 2.5V. This is amazing consistency and they all easily meet their minimum capacity rating.

I am rating this Molicel at 30A and 4000mAh. Molicel is working on adding a good cycle life continuous current rating and a higher temperature-limited rating (much like Sony/Murata does) to their datasheets to make it easier for us to directly compare their cells to others used by us.

Five cells were donated for the purposes of testing by Moli (http://www.molicel.com/hq/about/aboutus1.html) and N-Power Energy, Ltd. Thank you!

These tests only note the ESTIMATED ratings for these batteries at the time I tested them. Any battery that is not a genuine Samsung, Sony, LG, Panasonic, or Sanyo can change at any time! This is one of the hazards of using “rewrapped” batteries or batteries from other manufacturers so carefully research any battery you are considering using before purchasing.

Misusing or mishandling lithium-ion batteries can pose a SERIOUS RISK of personal injury or property damage. They are not meant to be used outside of a protected battery pack. Never exceed the battery’s continuous current rating and keep the plastic wrap and top insulating ring in perfect condition.

Any rating in my ratings tables can change at any time as different grade cells appear on the market, we get swamped with fakes, or new information becomes available to me. Please, never assume that the ratings in the tables are permanent and will never change! Always download the latest version before considering any cell purchase.

t3_9s1jzr,Uwell Crown v1 RBA Wicking - Anyone still looking for how?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/3vllb1/rba_wicking_for_uwell_crown/

I was reading up on others' experiences while I use my RBA right now. Wicking like a champ. I was scared it was going to leak everywhere. 

How I did it:

run the cotton through, make sure it's enough of course. Clip it off to almost too little (very close to the extents of the deck itself). Train the cotton upward, sort of holding it small while you place the cap over it. Once the cap is in place, if any cotton stayed out, take it back off, then clip those, they will already show where by pressing the cap over it. 

Once trimmed the final time, replace the cap with the wick tails trained upward. Now, just stuff them down, and clear the sides of the coil as best you can. It's not about being gentle as much as putting them where they go. You can actually fluff them a bit after. Just watch the flow holes so you know those are covered throughout any fiddling.

The RBA is a tight, restrictive lung hitter. The tank is too large with the barrel a bit too long overall to be a decent MTL. If you like restrictive lung hits, you will like the RBA for the crown. They, and the tank itself, are very cheap these days.

The flavor is decent, the stock coil that was in it is 0.28 ohms. It vapes just fine at 45w on my RX200.

Even though the juice feed holes are very low to the deck, don't even vape it under the coil cage, fill it up at that point. One sideways vape and it dries right out on the unexposed side (obvious in hind sight. didn't taste great! Thought I judged the wick good too soon, however discovered the issue pretty quickly when looking at the tank again after correcting the angle and watching the levels go down to refill the cotton in the coil lol).

Definitely pull after release of the button for an instant after as well. Seems to keep it from starting to mute out or feel like it's going dry without having to do a priming pull between rests.

I'm running some Kilo Cinnamon Roll in the second fill and the flavor is coming through great. I think the RBA performs and tastes better than the stock coils did, hands down.

Well, if anyone out there is still wondering about RBA section wicking for crown v1, has one sitting around, or just bought one dirt cheap like I did (actually, I got 2 of them for 99 cent each lol), this one's for you. My crown airflow ring was all unstable and didn't click anymore. I'm sure this one will go that way, too, however it's nice to have a new crown around to vape on for a bit. Something new (RBA for crown is new to me) through the clearances of something old (crown replacement).

Whoever breaks out the crown and the RBA just for this thread, you are the real MVP. I'd give gold randomly to one person out of anyone who wicks up a Crown RBA tonight, however I don't think my account is old enough or karma high enough to do that yet, I'll need to review the rules again.

Vape on, homies.

Edit: I lied, you can totally MTL this with the airflow completely closed, since uwell crown v1 leaks air when closed just enough to mtl WITH THIS tight wicking and RBA deck.",Sun Oct 28 00:43:36 PDT 2018,BisVaping
t3_9s1f4d,How does the flavour compare between a mtl tank and a rda,"Hi I'm currently vaping on a vandy vape pyro (great rdta!) however I want to get back into mtl vaping. I was thinking of getting something like a vapefly galaxies or something similar where the reviews say about how good the flavour is.
My question though is how does the flavour from a mtl tank for example the galaxies rta compare with your typical dripper tank. Are rda's still the king of flavour or would a mtl tank give better flavour?

t3_9s1eh6,Phantom rotating coils?,"I don't know if this is common for other people, but my could seem to twist themselves while I use my vape and loosen up until they're basically out of the tank completely. I'm not rotating my tank at all so I really don't know how it happens.

I screw the coil into the bottom of the tank pretty securely, and after I go through a full tank, I remove the top of the tank and the coil will come right out and be attached to the tank itself rather than the base where I initially screwed it in.

I'm not sure what the purpose for it is, and I can tell a difference in my hits as the coil starts to come out. Has anyone else seen this happen, and is it common? How do I prevent it and keep my coil secured into the base of the tank?

t3_9s13cj,Asmodus Minikin 2 not charging.,"Hi guys, first post here; I've read the rules but let me know if there's anything I missed by posting this.

&#x200B;

I haven't seen anything online regarding my particular issue. My Minikin 2 recently stopped holding hardly any charge. What happens is the mod will show it being charged (the little batteries are filling up and stuff), but as soon as I unplug it from the micro-USB cable, it'll die within one or two vapes, sometimes dying mid-vape. I've tried charging it with different cables, from different sources (PC, wall charger), different batteries, everything. I've charged it for about 2 hours before without use, and the same result occurs.

&#x200B;

I'm kind of at a loss here guys. I paid $250\~ for this mod, and I'm pretty chapped at the prospect of having to buy a new one. Anyone have the same issue or have a solution?

t3_9s0wdr,A bit confused with what I'm doing,"I recently made the switch to vaping over smoking cigs, had my setup for about 4 months but I've only been using it daily for about a month now. At the advice of a friend I picked up a Sub Tank Mini from Kangertech as well as a Kangertech KBOX 200 with 2 Efest IMR 18650s. I've been using the RDA that comes with the sub tank.


I've been doing a lot of research but I can't seem to get some things straight.

If I build my own coils am I being safe?

What constitutes a ""Mech-Mod"" or a ""Personal Vape""? I've heard they can be dangerous.


Some people at my local vape shop have suggested that I use pre-built coils as it may be too advanced for me to build my own, being a relative beginner and all. Is this true? I run sub-ohm setups, usually around .6-.9 ohms. I've heard this can be hard to nail down correctly. But I've tried OCC coils and they taste awful in comparison. Sure it's a pain to wrap a coil, thread wicks, get the right air flow, and everything else associated with building your own coils but I feel relatively safe with what I'm doing. I don't plan to upgrade to a Mech Mod or anything crazy but I do have a slight fear that I'm over looking something. ",Sat Oct 27 22:14:42 PDT 2018,Magrassa

t3_9ryd5w,"My EightVape Experiences - A review for You, Some Feedback For Them. ~BisVaping~","I'll keep this as short as possible. It's my first review here. It won't have any formatting or anything, it's not a formal review of a product I was provided. Just my two cents review about my experiences with EightVape. I'm just going to write out my experiences and provide some value to our peers here on the sub.

The first time I ordered on 8V was during the Labor Day events. The tank I ordered was not in stock. I was offered the ability to pick another, I opted for the partial refund. It took a few days, then I mailed again, and my package finally shipped. It came quickly, correctly, I was happy. I chose the economy envelope shipping, nothing fancy.

I looked at it like: They just had a massive sale on a big sales day, once shipped, it came really fast, all the way across the country, I understand a delay combined with the stock hiccup. I'm satisfied, I like EightVape. Cool.

Then, I saw posts on here popping up saying to beware EightVape. So, I decided I would order again specifically to write up my thoughts on it for you all here afterward in this post.

I went to the crazy clearance going on there as I write this and bought some stuff, as well as shopped for a couple of bottles of juice. I did not use ""Shipping Guarantee"". Whatever that is, I did not need on Labor Day, I don't need it now, I left a note letting them know I am sure I don't need it now, as well.

My order was placed on Wednesday night, guys. Probably after processing was complete for the day. It was like 10pm eastern I think. It processed at 8:30ish am 25th, when the label was created, was accepted just before 7PM, and ""arrived"" at its first ""in USPS hands"" location one hour later at 8 pm, for a same day turn around. All is good so far. Today itwas out for delivery at 9am today in my tiny post office and I just opened the package and got everything I ordered just fine, once again satisfied, this time without a hiccup.

I bought a replacement for my 3 year old crown for 10 bucks, two RBA decks for it at 99 cent each (not even clearance, nice price lol), 2 bottles of juice, and a drip tip.

Companies take some time to fulfill sometimes. Apparently they have a fulfillment center through their sister site or something I read from one of their posts while looking into this between then and now, so I suspect when the complaints roll in about EightVape, they are during massive sales when those kinds of things are going to be more frequent just because a whole bunch of people who usually don't even shop there are suddenly rushing for the prices, coupons, and clearances. Makes sense to get slowed down like that.

Go to Walmart on a Friday night. Now go on a Tuesday. Same concept. So, as a 2 time customer, once very quickly assisted, and second time around no hiccup at all, great shipping, great prices they are known for, I can give EightVape my thumbs up as a place to buy my stuff. They have apparently had problems before my first shopping with them, they appear to be doing better now in my experience so far. I plan to order from them more. I hope they provide a ""mystery flavor"" option so I can buy some ""surprise me"" once in a while.

As we go into the Holiday Season, remember in advance that the USPS is going to be strained pretty hard by the weather getting bad in many parts of the country as well as massive surges in shipped items for the gift giving festivities of the season.

This is just my opinion, I wasn't asked to write this review, I did it on my own. That said, I would love to do more of them for various aspects of vaping. From store experiences to gear to juices.

Thanks for reading. Thanks EightVape for being, in my opinion, a perfectly viable source for vape goods with a great value for many of the inventory they offer.

Feedback for EightVape: Do away with the shipping guarantee thing. Keep your focus on high volume, great prices. Absorb loss yourself. You can if you keep up your other things. You know your business better than any of us. I just think it is not going to be easily overlooked by most people.",Sat Oct 27 15:30:27 PDT 2018,BisVaping

**Species V2 Mod**

Another device from the manufacturer that everyone loves to hate, the Species V2 is here to scoop up some of the popularity gained by it's older brother. I know many people had issues with the first Alien, and there seemed to be some issues with QC for that device, but you can't deny that it was probably the most popular vaping device to date. While it slightly resembles the Alien, the Species V2 has a style all it's own and the performance to match it's new look. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's jump off this review and start at the best place possible: the top.

**Top/510:** The top of the Species V2, to me, resembles the shoulder line of a person, that's about the best way I think I can describe it. Where the neck would be is the centered 510. Around the 510 is a rectangular box with rounded corners that sticks out slightly from the contours of the chest line and shoulders. This give the Species V2 a nice platform to fit up to 30mm attys without any overhang. The 510 plate is a small, circular disk that's flush with the body of the device and houses a spring-loaded, gold-plated 510 pin.

---

**Buttons:** There are really only 2 buttons to speak of with this device: the fire bar and the screen lock button. The fire bar rests on one side of the device, the side where grip activation is better suited for right-handed vapers. Lefties are going to half to palm the screen if they want that same grip fire experience. I much prefer to grip-fire my devices that are designed as such without having to palm the screen, but I've gotten used to thumb-firing them, so it's not that horrible. Fire bar activation, while better towards the top of the bar, can be done a bit more than halfway down the button. The clickyness of it is fairly nice without being squishy and the resistance is nice and stiff, enough so to seemingly avoid accidental pocket firing. One slight issue is since both sides feel the same, it can be hard to distinguish which side the fire bar is located on if you're not familiar with the device.

The screen lock button is located on the front of the device directly under the screen. It is dual purpose, acting to send the device into/out of stealth mode with one press and locking/unlocking the screen with a long press. Clickyness is there and it activate very nicely.

---

**Screen/Menu:** The screen on the Species V2 is a colorful 1.45"" touch display. Colors can be changed to suit your preferance and most functions are handled via the screen, except locking/unlocking the fire bar, which can be achieved by pressing the fire bar 3 times. To access the device menu you must unlock the screen and hit the menu button located in the top left corner of the screen. This opens up your settings menu and gives you control over your firing modes and parameters, your puffs settings, screen adjustments, and a generic settings menu where you can adjust your ohms, factory reset your device, and turn it off. The menu is quite easy to operate and very intuitive. My complaint here is that some of the options are quite small and the people with fat fingers like myself might have some issues pressing the desired options. While this did not plague me often, it happened enough to be slightly annoying. I also noticed that the touch screen does not do well with any sort of slight condensation or dirt on it and will start adjusting itself depending on where the dirt is located. The best option is to be sure your screen is free of any debris before trying to adjust things. Unlike some device screens, the one on the Species V2 seems quite resillient to scratches, which is great since you're going to be wiping it off often.

---

**Battery Compartment:** The battery compartment is located on the bottom of the device and is secured via a locking latch system. The latch release button has a very nice tolerance and the latch itself stays closed nice and securely. The latch is spring-loaded and is done so very well, with very minimal play. The battery compartment secures batteries in place very nicely without much wiggle room to cause any kind of battery rattle. It also has marked battery orientation located on inside of the latch door.

---

**Size/Styling:** Because of it's zinc alloy construction, the Species V2 comes with a bit of heft to it, especially after adding your dual 18650s to the device. It's not all bad though, as it really does feel like a solid device. The size is very nice for a dual 18650 device and I especially like the inward slant that it has as it moves towards the bottom. It's not the slimmest of devices either, but it's also far from being considered anywhere near large.

The styling of the device is quite to my liking, being comprised primarilly the main color with an accent box that runs around the entire device, from front, over the shoulders, and down the back. The back of the device has a scale pattern on it (I guess to go with the whole Species moniker) and has SPECIES name written towards the bottom. I think it would've look a lot cleaner without the pattern, but apparently, scales and honeycomb are all the rage these days for whatever reason.

---

**Performance:** Probably coming as a surprise to most, but not to me, is that the performance of the Species is mostly great. I've only used a few Smok devices during my time vaping (Treebox Plus and Smok Mag Baby), but considering how much hate Smok gets, I've been very pleased with the device. Power mode works well. Power deliver feel a bit weaker than most of my preferred devices, even in Max mode. This would have to be my biggest complaint. Max really feels like Normal and all the other settngs feel grosely underpowered. If you keep it on Max, though, you're good to go. Ramp-up time is really minimal and at this point pretty much all devices have got this nailed down. One great thing I want to mention here is a common issue that comes with quick firing devices. When you multi-click the fire bar/button to enter your settings or turn off your device, it ends up firing the device with each click. This is just a side effect of having a device that fires so quickly. The cool thing that Smok has seemingly done is to program the device to recognize when you are clicking it multiple times and reset your firing of the device with each click. How are we just getting into this? Most devices have this issue, so it's nice to see that Smok have handled this well.

Moving on to TC. I was able to get really good performance from TC after adjusting a few settings. TCR values feel a bit weak, but once I was able to dial it in, it performed really well. Power delivery was nice and even and it tapered off without any jarring cutoffs or pulsiness. The Species also seems to have great dry-hit detection. I purposely vaped my RDA dry then took 10 long puffs without any sort of dry hit or burnt taste. Just great!

---

**TFV8 Baby V2 Tank:** Included in the Species V2 Kit is one of their latest tanks, the TFV8 Baby V2...wait, that can't be right. 4, 8, 12...8? Ohhh, V2. Gotcha, I guess. I'm not a naming expert and at this point the names of Smok tanks are starting to confuse me. Regardless, the Baby V2 is a top-filling adjustible airflow subohm tank that utilzes a new line of Smok mesh coils. Well, it seems like they have a few new lines of mesh coils. You got the Baby V2 and the Prince mesh coils. These coils are not compatible with one another's respective tanks and just really seem to add more confusion when it comes to identifying your appropriate coils. But I digress.

The Baby V2 has a fairly standard look to it when it comes to Smok tanks and utilizes pretty much what every Smok tank has over the past few iterations. Top fill with a swinging hinge latch and an unlock button, adjustible bottom airflow on a stopper, widebore drip tip. The driptip on the Baby V2 however is quite proprietary, sliding on to a double o-ring protrusion from the top of the tank. Not sure why they went this route instead of their typical dual o-ring 810 drip tip, but it definitely makes it harder to customize.

Performance of the coils is very nice. I primarilly used the Baby V2 A1 single mesh coil and really enjoyed the flavor out of this thing. I actually liked it a bit better than the Freemax Mesh Pro single coil mesh, getting more flavor out of it and decent longevity. I put roughly 60ml of ejuice through the coil and when I decided to switch, it didn't look much worse for wear. At that point flavor was a bit reduced, but I probably could've put much more juice through it without it being gross. All in all, the performance was very good

**Final Thoughts**

**Pros**

* Fits 30mm attys without overhang
* Spring-loaded, gold-plated 510
* 510 threading is smooth
* Can activate fire bar for most of its length
* Fire bar clickiness
* Stiff resistance on fire bar
* Screen lock button is a great feature (although, really a must with a touchscreen device)
* Large, colorful display
* Menu is intuitive
* Touch screen is responsive
* Batter latch nice and secure
* No battery rattle
* Solid zinc alloy construction
* Feels solid
* Small size
* Style is mostly appealing
* Power Mode Performance (on Max)
* Multi fire bar press recognition
* TC performance
* Baby V2 flavor

**Cons**

* Can be initally hard to differentiate which side fire bar is on
* Lefties have to palm the screen to grip fire
* Some screen options to small for touch activation
* Screen has to be constantly cleaned so it doesn't adjust on its own
* A bit heavy
* Would've like a plain back instead of of the scale pattern
* Power mode settings very weak
* Baby V2 longevity could be better

&nbsp;

Regardless of the history that Smok has around here, I have to say, the Species V2 is quite the great device. It checks off a lot of my boxes. Great size, great feel, nice screen, great power and TC performance. As long as Smok can keep their QC up throughout the life of this device's manufacturing, they're going to have, yet again, one of the most popular devices on the market.

**About**

I say this is an Average Vaper Review because I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who has been vaping for a while (8 years), but doesn't get too in-depth with the technical aspects of the products. I'm evaluating these products as to how well they work out the box, their ease of use, and whether or not they hold up over the course of use. I don't have the skill set to produce thorough testings of the electronics and I defer that to those better suited. This review is purely my experience using the items I received.

We basically started on Thursday with the Rehearsal Dinner for my buddies wedding, and then did Bachelor/Bachelorette Party the next day, a throwback Halo 2 LAN party at my house for all the groomsmen on Saturday (3 Original Xboxs, 3 27"" Sony Trinitron CRT TVs, and a crappy 10/100 switch just like back in the day), had the Wedding on Sunday, and then I got to be the Airport bitch on Monday and drive people out that flew in.  

Follow that up with a lovely 2 day internet outage and I decided just wait until this weekend to get the post put together :)

This one is seriously jam packed with WTF, some pretty awesome Mods, 18mm RDAs and RTAs, and a Unicorn vape band. Hope you all enjoy it, and didn't miss me too much.

t3_9rx1f2,Juul vs. MYLE info/review,"

i had been hearing good things about the MYLE, even hearing that it could be a juul killer so i picked one up out of curiosity... strawberry and tobacco pods

some thoughts:

-build quality is very good, a bit shorter and wider than the juul

-pods click in nice and seem to stay clicky

-the charging adapter is similar to the Juul, just a bit wider. i think they have a usb cable too but that didn’t come with the starter pack i got

-really enjoyed the strawberry flavor, natural and clean tasting. i used to be really into fruit medley and after awhile i couldn’t stand it at all. i wish the “fruity” juul was more similar to the myle strawberry... imagine if the fruit medley was good, that’s what this strawberry is like

-the cubano tobacco is “ok”. i a huge fan of the Juul Virgina Tobacco, it’s all I run besides the occasional crepe brûlée.(idk what you people see in the mint, it tastes like eating toothpaste to me lol) the Cubano is like a mix between Juuls tobacco and creme brûlée. its not good enough IMO to run all the time for me. ill finish the 4 pods for sure, maybe i’ll squire a taste for it we will see

-the airflow/draw is more “open” than the Juul—easier to pull. hard to say if that makes it “better”, more so just different. you can take in more vapor and faster, much less effort. I find myself being able to hit it more frequently on a “smoke break” because of the less effort. It produces a good amount of vapor and i was getting some nice crackles right away with the strawberry pod.
-the dealbreaker— these pods are the 5% (50 or 59mg range whatever) nic salts just like the Juul, but I get very very very little throat hit. I can pull on it for 10 seconds and my lungs do get full but no throat punch really. This is a big deal to me as I am an ex-smoker. It does give you a decent buzz but I think the Juul is better in this regard too. It’s just lacking in that cigarette satisfaction department.


I’ve tried almost all of these pod devices. Normally I run multiple subohms, RDAs, tanks, AIOs and the Juul on the side during my day, I like to mix things up. I do run higher nic freebase in my sub ohms, as high as 18 sometimes.... but as we know high nic freebase just kind of gets more harsh/peppery rather than giving you that throat kick. The MYLE sort of reminds me of the Breeze 1 in terms of how the vapor feels going in, and the temperature of it.(the breeze 1 produces more vapor though).


It all comes down to the juice that the Juul has. After messing around with different brands of nic salt juice, you can tell that they aren’t all the same. Nothing has beaten the Juul throat hit/cigarette style satisfaction.


The MYLE is a very good device. I’m tempted to empty a Virgina Tobacco pod into a MYLE pod just to see.... I would say that if the MYLE had the exact Virgina Tobacco juice, it would be a better product than the Juul. But as it stands, Juul is still the king to me. I’m gonna check youtube to see the deal with refilling MYLE pods and Ill get back on here and let you know how the Juul juice works in other devices.


God I wish Juul would sell their juice by the bottle. I know they are making a huge profit on juice. If my math is right, At $15.99 a pack, it’s $5.71 a ML. That would be like spending $342 on a 60ml bottle of juice.... So with such a huge profit in that there is probably no chance they would start selling the juice on its own.",Sat Oct 27 12:33:09 PDT 2018,cruD5C

I’ve been imprinted that tobacco = bad since young so I don’t really want to break the abstinence, but I’ve been pretty stressful and ‘destructive’ lately so the vice seems more enticing per day.

I have smoked shisha occasionally in bars and mary-j on travels to places where its legal/socially acceptable but none of these are very available to me, especially the latter (that I would much rather get into) because weed is super unavailable where I’m from.

Should I get into non-nicotine vape? Rational me really don’t want to start smoking.

t3_9rtjzl,Freemax Mesh Pro vs Uwell Nunchaku,"Hi all!

I've been eyeing the Mesh Pro for a bit but have a few questions about it.

I currently use the Nunchaku. Love the flavor but the coil dies in 4 days. To be fair, I do chain vape and use sweet juices. But do you all think the Mesh Pro coils would last a bit longer? Also, how does the flavor compare? I was reading and thinking about using the double mesh. I'm not concerned with the clouds, just the flavor and coil longevity.

Would it be worth it to get the Mesh Pro?

Thanks in advance!

t3_9rs99a,Breeze 2: Worst vaping device ever made?,"I just don't get the hype at all. This is, without a shred of a doubt, the worst vaping experience I've ever had in my life. Is it a gag novelty product or something? That's a better explanation than arguably the most popular vapor brand producing this as a legit and reliable product. I don't get the point of quitting cigarettes if I end up spending even more just on coils that turn out to be duds 98% of the time. I've been reading that some people end up throwing away 4/5 coils in a pack, a pack is $15-20 each. 

I've yet to put a coil in the device that doesn't immediately flood. I get an immense load of spitback juice in my mouth every time I fire it. And if I don't get spitback, then the device just literally doesn't even produce vapor. I hear the sound of it firing, I hear the juice bubbling, and NOTHING comes out of it. I have tried cleaning all of the O-Rings, replacing them, I've tried taking the coil out and blowing the liquid out, I've tried loading a coil into the device without priming, and nothing changes. The same thing happens to my sister's Breeze consistently. And if it's not bad enough, if I get lucky and avoid spitback and flooded coils as well as lack of vapor entirely, then what I get is a huge wave of burnt coil in my mouth. Matter of fact, I don't think I've actually taken a successful draw from this piece of crap other than when I first bought it. 

It has been nothing but anger and disappointment, this from one of the most popular vapor brands on the market. I just don't get what I'm doing wrong, I just want a simple and easy to use small vape system. Nobody has found a fix to these problems, Aspire does nothing to improve or even address these major flaws in their device.

Well when I was testing out different wattage curves I noticed that when I would go back to m1 it was the exact same as m2..

When I went back to m1 it was the exact same as m2...

t3_9rrpea,T/c mode issues (Geekvape legend),"Hi all. I’m new to vaping and am trying to set up my mod in t/c mode because I am constantly scorching coils (4-5 a week) in wattage mode without running the tank dry.   I do have a tendency to chain vape because I went full stop on smoking and I believe this to be the cause. 

I am using the Geekvape legend 200w with the fireluke freemax mesh tank. I have the correct .12ohm stainless coil installed to accommodate t/c mode and it is rated for between 400-550f for t/c mode. I have tried for days to get some settings that work with zero luck. 

All I seem to be getting is a dry (almost) flavorless vape, where in wattage mode I was getting a great tasting , and slightly damp vape using the same 70/30 vape juice. 

Here are the settings that I am running in tc-ss mode

480f
.12ohm (locked)
70wat
112 tcr 

Is the dry tasteless vape all I can expect out of temp control, or are my settings wrong? If so, please advise. I’m at the point of being so frustrated with trying to dial this thing in that after nearly a month without a cigarette, I’m contemplating just grabbing a pack next time I’m out.

I've tried running ni80 and 316l both 24ga 3 ID with about 7 wraps or so coming out to around .65-.70 ohms and both slightly thinning to thinning in my kylin mini and regardless of what I do I get a slight gurgling in the chamber.

I've tried upping my wattage as well but seems best around 20-25. I've tried no juice in the tank whatsoever, and also half full.

I've also tried 50/50, 65/35 and 80/20 juice and still no difference.

I'm not getting juice in my mouth and the flavor seems good but this gurgling noise can't be normal. Any advice?

There's enough lead to get one extra wrap in on each leg, bringing me up to 8 total...but even then the thing won't fire.  I don't really know what else to do.  It's not like I wasted a lot of money on them, but would like to salvage them if I can.  I don't have any other rebuildable devices to put them on.  Maybe I could try unwrapping them all and wrapping them around a different jig?

t3_9rpjjp,CALLING ALL WASHINGTON STATE VAPORS,"*Mods remove if this isn't allowed*

Hey everyone.  So I just found this out yesterday from my friend Steven. He owns a few shops in the state and is huge on Advocacy and working with the PLB (Pink Lung Brigade). Recently it was brought to our attention that an appeal from the Board of Health, has been made to overturn the case that would get rid of vape lounges in Peirce County. Every shop would be forced to get rid of their couches, TV, Gaming Consoles, it would restrict how many people could be in at a time.  It would turn shops into just a Vape Mini Mart. You wouldnt be able to hang out like you are now. It's being taken to a State Level, meaning if the Board wins this appeal it won't just effect Peirce County, ANY COUNTY in the state of Washington can choose to adopt this into their law.  If we win this, then they can never come after us again on this issue. It would be a A huge victory.  


If you've never heard of PLB, they're the reason why Washington isn't 21+ for Vaping, there is not 60% tax on Vaping.  They've fought for us and have won every single court battle that's been thrown our way.

t3_9rp3tv,A short theoretical mathematical approach of getting a more correct tcr value of a mesh coil?!,"*If this is common knowledge, slap it in my face, please. I did not find any good explanations regarding mesh*

As some (most?) know the standard TCR values for our wires cannot be applied when using mesh in TC mode. This bugged me for some days now. A somehow successful trial and error approach at moving the TCR value down till it's consistent made me think about a mathematical/physical solution to this.

Because the mesh heats up in the middle/center first and then spreads out to the sides I assumed the resistance plotted over the width of the mesh behaves like some sort of a parabola, where the sides do not change that much in resistance than the hot spot plagued center.

In this scenario the TCR value would be the height of the parabola and we just need to adjust it (=normalize).

Taking a normal parabolas area from -a to a, height a, we get 1.33a.

Assuming the regular wire has no such behavior, it's area (rectangle) from -a to a, height a, would be 2a.

The normalizing factor would be 1.33a / 2a = 0.665 if we only take the width of the mesh into account. (There's also a conical volume approach which should be tried too = factor 0.5).

The TCR value for SS316 that I use on regular coils is 0.88‰. Multiplied with the normalizing factor this leads to 0.58/0.59‰. This setting produces very consistent temperatures on my setup without burning the cotton. (At slight below max temperature for my cotton).

What are your thoughts on this? 

I'm sorry that I don't have the equipment to  check this empirical. Maybe someone else has the opportunity.

Edit: My current subjective tests favor the factor 0.5 more than 0.665. Please try it for yourself. Just put half the TCR into your mod.",Fri Oct 26 15:05:28 PDT 2018,beepBob4

t3_9rngxr,"I Made a thing! Introducing the new cthulhu mjölnir rDA Preview designed by me, anthony vapes","Hi Reddit peeps, I’m making this post to introduce you to a new RDA that i designed in collaboration with Cthulhu Mods named the Mjölnir RDA. I won’t be doing a formal review as i believe it’s tacky to do so, so i’ll leave that up to other reviewers so this is more like a preview. I did want to introduce it and discuss some of the designs though and field questions about it. 

## What’s in a name?

Well naming things is not always easy so why Mjölnir? Well Mjölnir works quite a few ways for me personally. It’s the hammer of thor in both norse mythology and the marvel universe and considered one of the most powerful weapons. And i’m a sucker for both mythology and comics. Thor was one of my favorite superheroes when i was a kid. It’s also the name of the armor worn by master chief in the popular video game series halo which i’m a fan of as well so overall just seemed like a fitting name. It also sounds cool and should be funny with reviewers trying to pronounce it and butcher it. 


## So how did this all happen?

Well it started over a year ago. I was approached by Cthulhu in Summer of 2017 to design an atomizer, Originally I was going for a dual coil 30mm RTA as i felt there weren’t many good ones on the market at the time. It was just the aromamizer plus and modfather really but a few other good ones have come out since then. After several beta’s and fixes it was scrapped in favor of an RDA as it wasn’t “just right” as i needed it to be and wasn’t going to release a subpar product with my name on it, so early in january of 2018 we decided to go with an RDA as i felt the market lacked and still does a killer affordable easy to find single coil RDA that has great flavor and works excellent as a dripper and squonker and doesn't need a massive coil so can work well with mech squonkers. So that was the aim since then.

## How does it look?

For people who know my reviews , they know i’m not a fan of big cringy logos or crazy designed RDAs i like to keep it simple and classy looking but have a little bit of flair to it. So i added some useful knurling to the RDA. Here are some stock pics

## So what is the Mjölnir RDA?

It’s a single coil RDA designed to be used with low watt to medium watt DTL builds with a big aim on being perfect for mech squonkers and single battery squonkers but of course can be used just as good on a dripper or bigger mod as well. It’s focused on ease of build, Flavor, and leak protection. So lets give a run down of the specs and features

##Double Chamber

It’s a 24mm RDA overall however the extra size is for function. What you really have is a 20mm RDA shoved inside a 24mm enclosure. Doing that allows for a reduced chamber while allowing for the other features i’ll go over to exist. It also dissipates heat so you won’t get any hot lips from this RDA even when chain vaping.I call it the “double chamber” design as you can see in this [pic](https://i.imgur.com/f2LY2E7.jpg)

##Build Deck

The build deck is nothing new or fancy, but it is a simple tried and true proven deck that’s easy to build on. Going with a simple 2 post design with posts on opposite sides and cut out slits on each post. It’s basically a smaller version of the deck used in many RDAs like the wasp nano, ammit 25 RTA, asmodus C4 RDA etc. i love that style deck for its ease of building personally so no need to reinvent the wheel on every part of this RDA. going with a known good build deck people know how to build on and is easy was a key for me. And of course it’ll have my favorite good quality hex grub screws. It can accommodate up to a 4mm ID coil

##Top Cap

As i said earlier i like to keep things simple. The top cap itself has no visible logo. I didn’t want it too plain though so went with a knurling on the bottom and some ribbing on the top. It gives it a little flair and also adds grip since you turn the whole top cap to adjust the airflow so it has style and function. It also locks into place to make it easy to screw on and off your mod. It’ll lock in with the air fully open one way and fully closed the other way

##Standard Accessories 

The Mjölnir RDA will come with 2 drip tips. A resin 810 tip and a clear PMMA 510 tip as well as a 510 adapter and you can use any of your own tips. Resin and clear are my 2 favorites these days so i went with those personally. But of course if you don’t like those options you can use any of your own. It’ll also come with a squonk pin of course

##Airflow and over drip/over squonk protection

Now the airflow, as everyone knows i’m a flavor guy so the obvious choice for me is bottom airflow. Everyone knows bottom airflow is best for flavor it’s no secret in vaping. So the trick was how to get bottom airflow but still have great protection for squonking and dripping down the center. What i went with is an “open” airflow design that comes in from the side but is angeled via full tubes not just angeled into an open area that takes the air right under the coil. What this allows for is a true bottom airflow that you can drip right down the center and it’ll pass through the bottom air right into the massive sized juice well. When squonking the juice well it’s so large and the deck and airflow is raised up that you can squeeze the hell out of the bottle and not get a leak. It’s very beginner squonk friendly and allows for dripping down the center without the sacrifice of losing flavor like the other protecting RDAs on the market

[airflow](https://i.imgur.com/Dav2aFT.jpg)

## So in short why should people be interested in this?

Well i felt the need to fill a gap in the market. There are good single coil RDAs out there, but nothing you can find that is affordable, widely made, that focuses on flavor, has a massive juice well, doesn't need a big build but can work with one, gives over squonk protection, has a massive juice well, and allows you to drip right down the center. It flat out doesn’t exist. All the good ones are missing some piece of that puzzle. There isn’t even a bottom airflow squonking single coil RDA i’m aware of as most of them are side airflow and a couple are top airflow. I have to say i’m pretty proud of the design and I think it fits a need that many vapers have currently who have settled on dealing with something lacking from the good options out there.

##where can i buy it , how much is it, and is it available?

Right now it’s available on cthulhu’s site for 29.99 here https://shop.cthulhumod.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=93 (link is ok they don’t see juice) not sure where in the US but if i get any updates on who will carry it i’ll be happy to let people know. Official product page is here https://www.cthulhumod.com/mjolnir-rda-unique-double-chamber-system/ and i should have a giveaway for a couple of them soon as well :)


I will make a video on this as well and build tutorial hopefully next week and will let you all know when it’s up but in the meantime feel free to ask questions or discuss it :) review samples will be in the hands of reddit reviewers shortly as well #teampositivty!

My knowledge is that the chamber size, the distance from coil to mouth and the stream directly hitting the coil is important for flavor.

##Initial Impressions and features

When I first got this Mod, I was pretty impressed with the design. It has the large 2 inch color screen and the symmetrical shape with a front facing fire button like a modefined lyra or hcigar wildwolf but with a bigger screen. The one thing that was odd though was they have a 26mm platform on top for your atomizers, would have been nice to leave it flat as it would have been able to handle a 30mm atomizer but instead with the platform it’s a 26 max unless you don’t mind the platform overhang gap. Outside of that though it ticked most of the boxes i like in a mod so overall I was liking it from the start.


##Watt Mode Performance (chart and spreadsheet in picture album)

Now let’s get into some data. I ran my normal testing. I used Sony VTC5A batteries for the testing. Testing resistances were done at .122, .147, .19, and .628 ohms. wattage points were max (234), 200, 150, 100, 75, 50 and 25. At .122 ohms it maxed out at 209 watts and 41 amps.  For the rest of the testing it was on the low side 7-16 watts at 100+ but only 2-4 watts under 100 watts. Pretty typical struggle at that resistance and on par with most.  At .147 it maxed out at 228 watts. The rest were pretty good 2-4 watts low 100 or more but 1-2 watts high under 100. For the .19 test it maxed out at 231 watts. Again really good but a little on the high side especially at higher wattages where it was way high 8-17 but under 100 6-9 watts high. For the .628 testing it maxed out at 99 watts and 7.889 volts. For the rest of the testing a little high 3-6 watts which is common. The volts shows there is no boost circuit in this mod like most dual battery mods.


Overall I felt the performance of this mod was really good. It struggled a little with the .122  ohm build which is common for most mods at that resistance to struggle a bit. It mostly hits slightly high at .2 or higher but slightly low under .2 overall though pretty accurate mod on par with many of the best ones. I was able to get 234 watts max, so I consider it to be accurately rated at 234 watts. The 7.889 volt limit shows there is no boost circuit. Their manual lists the max Volts at 8.4V so it does fall short of that. They list the theoretical limit which is impossible to achieve. I wish companies wouldn’t do that. If you don’t have a boost circuit the most you should list is around 8V no higher. They list an amp limit on this mod of 50A. The most i got was 41 with a .122 ohm coil which is above average for a dual battery mod (average is around 40 these days) but a bit short of the listed spec. I would have preferred it listed at 40. Personally If i was listing the specs I’d call the mod 230 watts, 8V and 40A. So overall not bad listings except the volt limit and amp limits which i feel are slightly overstated but not too crazy. The mod never got warm when stressing it at all. The mod also fires very fast and the preheats all work correctly.  The mod has a M1 mode (watt curve) which works well as well. One issue I had with this mod however is it would stop firing at times. There was no pattern or reason behind it I could find but sometimes it would just stop firing in the middle of a puff. It did it about 20 times in the first 200 puffs but less after and probably around 5% of the time or so but i stopped counting after that. Not a major deal but annoyed me and no other mods had this issue for me so it’s going to get dinged for it but from talking to other reviewers it seems i’m the only one with this issue


## Simplified TLDR Power Performance summary

Mod performance is good. Mostly hits just a few watts off on the high side at .2 ohms or more and a few low under .2 ohms. Accurately rated for watts (231), No boost circuit, above average amp limit of 41 but falls short of the 50A listed. Volts tested at 7.889 so a less than the 8.4V listed. M1 (watt curve) works as it should. Randomly stops firing mid puff at times.

##Temperature Control Performance 

Using SS316 wire in SS mode,  I tested 6 builds. 1 simple round single coil, 1 simple round dual Coil, 2 large fancy single coils builds, and 2 large fancy dual coil builds. The mod has full adjustable watts and full adjustable TCR in the preset modes but no TCR mode which is fine since you can adjust it anyway. With that said it’s really hard to pinpoint this one. Nothing I could do or adjust gave any sort of good vape or consistency to it. It was wildly all over the place no matter what I tried to do to dial it in. Overall Not something i’d recommend for TC usage as the best way i could describe it is it flat out doesn’t work at all. 


 

## Other Usage Notes

The mod uses a standard 5 click to lock or unlock the mod but to turn it off it’s in the menu system. The menu system is excellent however. There is a menu button.  Press menu 3 times to go into settings. It has power, bypass, watt curve (M1), and TC for SS, Ni200, and Ti wire. I really like that, very easy to use. Depending on your mode you have options for adjustments as well all laid out nicely.  In the menu there is a mode on the bottom, scrolling through that presents a ton of options. You have puff counter and clear puff (keeps a lifetime counter plus a counter you can reset) Screen font color settings, screen timeout setting, brightness, and wallpaper options. LED Settings, Board Temp, Live voltage readings from batteries individually, and FW version. Everything you can want from a menu system. The screen also displays individual battery charge as a % per battery. Which is great. Overall very well done and fully featured.

The Hoge Vapor Range GT234 adjusts by .1 watt increments under 10 watts and full watt increments 10 or more and also round robbins. Very well done there and fast and easy to adjust. The mod itself is built solid with no rattle at all, and has a good solid weight to it without feeling heavy. The Battery door is a standard magnetic black plate and It’s easy to get batteries in and out without damaging wraps and takes 2 18650 batteries. It fits great with no play on it and has a coating on the back for protection as well as a warning sticker so well done there. It doesn't need a ribbon and doesn't have one and works like the polar and charon mini mods. There are also 2 LED strips next to the screen which can be turned off or programmed to different colors and modes if that’s your thing


The paint on it looks nice overall and the red i have is red and not pink like some mods, however i do have some chipping on it already so not sure how well it will hold up over the course of a year or so. I think it’ll look pretty bad over time if my 5 weeks of useage put a bunch of chips in it already. The fire button is nice and clicky and a good size. It works well and It never gets stuck or anything though which is as it should be and is really comfy to use. The 510 pin gave me no issues and every atomizer i used on it worked great with no gaps. The mod handles a 26mm atomizer flush on the platform. The 510 is on a 26mm platform. I wish it would have had a flat top as then it could have taken a 30mm atomizer too. The screen is an excellent size 2 inch color screen that is nice and bright and easy to see. Once of the nicest screens I’ve seen out there along with the polar, charon mini, and proton. I love the screen on it. Also for branding the mod itself just the word ranger in the back in a matching color so nicely done. They list 2A charging as well but i don’t recommend charging internally in your mods and I don’t test charge rates of devices like this due to that.




##Pros:



* Power mode performance most of the time
* Accurately rated for watts
* good amp limit (41) but overrated
* good volt limit for a mod without a boost circuit
* batteries are easy to get in and out without damaging wraps
* excellent bright 2 inch color screen
* nice fire button
* handles 26mm atomizers without overhang
* watt curve mode (M1)
* good menu system
* easy to adjust wattage quickly
* individual battery voltage readings
* LEDs with lots of setting and can be turned off
* nice solid build quality and no button rattle
* good battery door
* nice symmetrical design





##Cons:
 

* TC performance awful
* overstated volt limit in specs
* only 2 color options 
* overstated amp limit in specs
* 26mm platform, if it was flat could handle a 30mm atomizer
* Mod stops firing mid puff randomly
* paint chipping






##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this mod or not? I don’t like to do a hard yes or no and this one i have to lean towards the no. It’s not a bad mod by any means and performs good in power mode (outside of the random times it stops firing) but dual 18650 battery mods have so many good options out there without the TC issues and power mode issues. It’s a shame as it’s close to being a really good mod and I love the screen and menu system. If it had working TC, no issues with the firing in power mode, and flatten the top so it takes 30mm atomizers it would be a great mod but as it stands now it’s not something I can recommend.  I won’t be adding this mod to my sheet of recs linked down below.


This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

t3_9rlmph,Battery question,Until I get an actual case to store my batteries in is it safe enough for me to keep my spare batteries in the charger as long as I unplug it,Fri Oct 26 08:18:02 PDT 2018,Janglysack
t3_9rlhnq,Haven't bought a new vape in years...need recommendations,"I've been vaping for 5 years now, from the original eGo pens to the MVP 2.0 and a few others. I've been using an iPV3 Li with a UWell Crown tank for at least a few years now and it's worked great but I am totally out of the loop and now I really just want something smaller since the iPV3 is a monster. Basically these are my criteria:

* Relatively small, fits in pocket comfortably
* Would prefer dual 18650, but I realize there are much smaller options with single 18650 so I'm open to that as well
* Doesn't need USB charging
* Don't care about temperature control
* I vape a 0.5ohm coil at 50W like 99% of the time, so doesn't need much more power than that

I'll probably get a new tank as well, so if you guys have any recommendations for a tank similar to the Crown (top fill, a couple airflow options, around the same size), that would be much appreciated. Thanks!",Fri Oct 26 08:02:28 PDT 2018,LabeledThings

t3_9rlb1u,pod systems,"i'm kinda torn between Smok Infinix, Smok Rolo badge and vaporesso Renova zero.  


pods for rolo badge and renova zero are difficult to find, meanwhile the the performance of zero (judging by reviews) seems better. though zero only comes in with 1 Pod and thats a big risk for me.   
rolo badge is slightly difficult to handle and grip while you are multi tasking and infinix's quality from the looks of it, the rubber piece to close the refill hole seems to be pretty average.  


guys i would really appreciate some input and if you have used these before, would love to hear you out ",Fri Oct 26 07:40:38 PDT 2018,Sb_br
t3_9rl9gq,What's the best sub-$50 device on the market that would be good for nicotine salts at a high concentration?,"I have a big box mod right now that i usually run 3 or 6mg but I'm thinking that i wanna tone it down size wise to something smaller, lighter and lets me use a higher nic concentration. 

I've used things like the Breeze, Juul and whatever Smoks new Breeze like device and didnt mind them but what would some other options be? I'd prefer to spend $50 or less but would be willing to do a little bit more if it'd be worth it. I live in Canada btw.

t3_9rkwg1,Beginner and not in the US - Need some advice,"I'm a happy beginner vaper who just made 2 months without analogs! My first device was a small Smok Pen 22, it was the worst experience ever, almost made me quit vaping, SO. MUCH. LEAKING. What saved my life was the Vaporesso Cascade One Plus, that thing is a really nice device.

&#x200B;

But I want more now, I will be going for my first regulated mod and, in the future, I want to switch to RDAs. I live in Brazil so my options here are pretty much limited (no Innokin at all, some Smoant variations plus a lot more of the good stuff).

&#x200B;

Please have in mind that the dollar costs around 3.9 times more than our money so things becomes really expensive over here. The mods that I'm more inclined to buy are:

&#x200B;

1- Vaporesso Polar ($89): It's a good price, comes with a tank (I will explain why this is important in the Minikin) and I like the mod aesthetic. My only concern is the screen, that seems to be a fingerprint magnet, it's not a deal breaker for me, but it's kinda of a bummer.

&#x200B;

2- Geek Vape Blade ($71): Awesome price, but I don't know if I like the Starry Night color (IDK if there is any color variations in the US, but over here, nope), really, I'm in conflict if I like it or not, sometimes seems a little ""too hipster"" for a 31 years old dude while sometimes it looks attractive just because it's a unique color, making contrast with all my friends dark and simple designs.

&#x200B;

3- Minikin V2 ($90): Minikin is the one that attracts me the most visually, especially the Rotten color variation. My problem is that I sell my old devices when buying a new one and the Minikin comes without a tank (I'm short of money so that would be kinda of a problem, RDA's are out of the equation right now, they are around 30$). Anyone have a good recommendation of a sub ohm tank that is good and cheap so I can lurk around?

&#x200B;

Any advice on these three mods? If you guys have any other mods recommendations please let me know so I can look for them over here.

t3_9rktoi,Best Top Airflow Dual Coil RTAs,"Hi all, I am looking for a new RTA. I already have a Kylin (leaky), Zeus single (love it) and a Themis (flavour not as good as Zeus, but obviously it's dual coil). I definitely prefer top airflow tanks.  


So I'd like to replace the Themis with a new dual coil RTA. The Themis is great, but it's very bulky and I feel that there's probably something out recently that will improve on its flavour. The Zeus Dual I think might be too similar to the Zeus single - I'd like to try something a bit different.   


I've seen the QP Designs Juggerknot. This looks great - maybe a little pricey, but if it's the best around, I'll pay for it. I've also seen the Dead Rabbit RTA - this gets good reviews, and is much cheaper than the Juggerknot. Any other suggestions pliz? :)

t3_9rkd07,Some advice please :),"I'm currently vaping on pods right now. Used an eleaf iCare 2, kangertech uBoat and right now I'm using an Aspire Breeze 2. Ive also used an eleaf iJust 2 which is a sub-ohm device but the throat hit wasn't enough at all. Ive recently quit smoking cigarettes so I strictly stick to 50mg salt nics or 12mg freebase nice juices on the pods since that's the kind of throat hit I need to get through the day. 

Anyway, I'm planning to venture into mods and tanks but I have no clue as to which one would suit me as I'm a kind of newbie to the vape world. 

From my understanding of reading quite a few threads on vaping, I would need to get a mod and a MTL tank. I was wondering if anyone could help me out with: 

1. which tank and mod would be suitable for me and also can I buy any mod for any tank and vice versa or is there some criteria where both have to match? 
 
2. Can I buy a MTL tank and screw it onto my iJust 2 mod? But the iJust 2 mod is pretty basic and has no temp control or any of the advanced functions other mods have.

t3_9rjwk3,Reminder - Please carry your batteries in protective cases or sleeves or risk explosions/serious burns!,"In the past few hours there's been 2 post about this.  Us 'old timers' take it for granted that there are still new users coming into the hobby on a daily basis and this knowledge isn't automatically known.

&#x200B;

So please, carry your batteries in a protective case, if you must carry them at all.   Not doing so risk shorting them out or causing thermal runaway to even the best batteries, which can burn the ever loving shit out of you.  If your battery is damaged, replace it! If your battery's protective wrap is torn or damaged, re-wrap or replace it!

&#x200B;

Cases can be found nearly everywhere online for no more than $1, and a lot of places like [IMRbatteries.com](https://IMRbatteries.com) will send them free when you buy batteries.

t3_9rjo0t,No buzz with Juul?,"Hi all-

For a while I've had an Aspire Breeze 2 which I love.  I have been using 25mg nic salt juice with a 1.0 ohm coil and it works great.  I only vape 3 times a day, but each time the Aspire gave me a great buzz.  I recently received a Juul and I was apprehensive because I know the Juul has 50 mg juice and a lot of folks say they think it's too strong, but I really like how discrete the Juul is etc.  

Now I understand the biology of nicotine addiction but I started hitting the Juul and to my surprise I never really got a buzz off of it? I made sure it's fully charged, I've tried different pods, and it's producing vapor, but it doesn't give me the same 3 min kick in the face the Breeze does using half the nicotine concentration. Can someone explain this?  Is the Juul broken or something?",Fri Oct 26 03:49:41 PDT 2018,asque2000
t3_9rjicy,Ecig explosion: safe vape ?,"Hi all,

Last week my 18650 battery exploded in my pocket. I am badly burned and will need skin grafting.However, I am still hooked on nicotine... and scared.

Anybody knows a battery type/brand and mods that are specifically engineered to be safe ? I don't care about the price and vape quality anymore, I am looking for something with higher industry standards.

Thanks a lot!VM

&#x200B;

edit:

Some conclusions I could draw from the discussion below (thank you all!).  
1- Never, ever carry batteries without a sealed, non-conductive box. Contact with coins or keys can short them, leading to failure.  
2- Get rid of batteries that seem damaged, they tend to ""vent"".  
3- Do not leave your home with batteries charging.  
4- Regulated mods with internal batteries are generally safer than mechanical mods. Innokin and DNA seem to produce good quality mod (no data).",Fri Oct 26 03:21:32 PDT 2018,Valmishra

t3_9ris8j,Advice for a tank upgrade?,"**Ahoy hoy!** Hopefully this is the right place to ask for buying advice*. 

I'm currently sitting on an Aspire Atlantis Evo and an Eleaf iStick 100W (the older, non-TC version with the batteries together rather than bizarrely on either side of the device). Unfortunately I got hit by a car a while ago, and so the mod's top plate is hanging on via a single screw, which means it's time for an upgrade before it dies completely. I've got a high end pair of Samsung cells that are still healthy, so I put an order in at Fasttech for a ""Authentic Eleaf Invoke 220W"" for starters, along with some Ni200 coils from both Steam Tribe and Atom Vapes ^gClapton ^SUBXERO ^OVC ^whatever ^that ^means for the Atlantis EVO to try out temp control for the first time. 

But it seems the Atlantis EVO is an obsolete model from what I can tell. The EVO coils I've used in it are meh and devour juice, the older 1.8Ohm Triton coil I thought might be nice to try is ... unsatisfying. The only ones I've yet to try are the 0.3Ohm coils from the Atlantis 2, which apparently are upto 80W which sounds good - The 0.4Ohm EVO was maxing out at maybe 50W at best before burning up.

Is it worth buying a 5 pack of those 0.3Ohm coils before buying a new tank? I can get them locally for only a bit more than Fasttech. I was thinking of the Uwell Crown 3 since I heard a long time ago they were great, and they're pretty cheap on Fasttech. Only thing is, I have zero clue what coil options are out there for them. 

Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated!

t3_9riium,"Wanted to share a story of how I stumbled onto something awesome, and get some advice for my next move.","Sorry for the long post, but I wanna share this story as I don't typically stumble onto something cool, TL;DR at the bottom.

So, something amazing happened today. I work at a VaporShark and have been for a few months now. My co workers always tell me about how awesome DNA chips are, but I never decided to get one.

Well, earlier today a customer comes in to get new batteries since his looked like time bombs, wraps all screwed up, saw sparks when he put them in, that fun stuff. So I got him a set of batteries for what looked like an RX200, which I happen to also have. However, when he puts the new ones in, it doesn't turn on, which is odd since we keep our batteries charged for customers. After confirming the batteries work in another mod he decides to get the RX300 3 battery since his is old. He leaves me the mod and old batteries to throw away, which I decide to keep after asking of he's sure he doesn't wanna keep the mod as a back up.

Now, I forgot to mention the mod still worked with the LG brown wraps, which I personally have but the shop doesn't. So I decide to keep the mod and see if I can get it working, and take his LGs to get rewrapped so I can keep them too. (I told him he could get them rewrapped but he decided to just get new ones since he was already there.)

After getting the batteries wrapped I get home and start tinkering with the mod. It seems like it's stuck in wattage mode, no temp control (which I happen to be using right now) no stealth mode, and wont turn off, only locks if I click 5 times. Note, I've never seen a DNA mod before, so I thought this was a RX200 that had really shitty firmware. So I download the firmware update, but my PC isnt recognizing the mod. I use my RX200 just to be sure and it works, just not this new one. So I decide to take it apart and keep it for spare parts for mine. Well, to my surprise as I pull the chip out it says DNA 200 right there.

I had a DNA chip fall into my lap and didn't even know what I had until I tore the damn thing apart. The chip is still fine, but now I need a home for it, which leads to my question. Does anyone know if there's somewhere I can send this chip to get it put into a mod? I'd do it myself, but I suck with this kind of thing.

TL;DR - Customer came into my shop today with a Wismec DNA 200. I didn't know that's what it was at the time. After getting a new mod and batteries he leaves me with the old setup. I eventually take it apart thinking it broken, only to find a DNA 200 chip. Now I need to find someone who can put this thing into a mod for me.",Fri Oct 26 00:09:03 PDT 2018,xBL4DE

t3_9rhq2m,"Bench Test Results, Early Samples: Molicel M42A 20A 4000mAh 20700...accurately rated, best 20700 up to 45W","Bottom Line: Moli and NPE sent me several of these cells for testing and my thoughts about their performance. They were manufactured for one of Moli’s customers but Moli wants to make it available to other markets. This is just a sneak peek at what’s coming, they hope to ship them to the rewrapping companies by the first quarter of 2019. I will retest them when they start shipping to the rewrappers.

As of now, Moli won’t be making this cell directly available to us in its original wrapper due to existing agreements.

This is a great performing 20700 that fills a performance “hole” in the 20700’s we can buy. It outperforms the Sanyo NCR20700B at all power levels. It even outperforms the Molicel INR20700A (and its rewraps from Efest, Vapcell, and others) and the Golisi S32 (and others using that same China manufactured cell) at up to about 15A/45W. At about 20A/60W or higher though those other cells outperform the M42A.

This is a high capacity “energy” cell, best suited for up to moderate power levels. It is not a “power” cell made for higher discharge current levels, like the Molicel INR20700A.

The datasheet lists 20A as the max continuous current rating but notes that cycle life is reduced at high current levels. I recommend staying at 15Α/45W or lower with the M42A to get the best performance and longest life from this cell.

The datasheet lists the minimum capacity at 4000mAh and typical capacity at 4200mAh. The four Molicels I tested delivered 4100mAh - 4149mAh at 800mA (0.2C) down to 2.5V. This is pretty good consistency and they easily meet their minimum capacity rating.

I am rating this Molicel at 20A and 4000mAh.

Five cells were donated for the purposes of testing by Moli (http://www.molicel.com/hq/about/aboutus1.html) and N-Power Energy, Ltd. Thank you!

These tests only note the ESTIMATED ratings for these batteries at the time I tested them. Any battery that is not a genuine Samsung, Sony, LG, Panasonic, or Sanyo can change at any time! This is one of the hazards of using “rewrapped” batteries or batteries from other manufacturers so carefully research any battery you are considering using before purchasing.

Misusing or mishandling lithium-ion batteries can pose a SERIOUS RISK of personal injury or property damage. They are not meant to be used outside of a protected battery pack. Never exceed the battery’s continuous current rating and keep the plastic wrap and top insulating ring in perfect condition.

Any rating in my ratings tables can change at any time as different grade cells appear on the market, we get swamped with fakes, or new information becomes available to me. Please, never assume that the ratings in the tables are permanent and will never change! Always download the latest version before considering any cell purchase.

t3_9rhjqs,Help! Eleaf iJust 3 LED light just blinking?,"I just changed my coil (didn't turn off the battery or anything), and my vape won't work now. When I press the fire button, it just blinks. The LED will blink orange when it's not plugged in or green when it is plugged in. The light just continues to blink as long as I hold down the fire button. The light blinks even when I have the tank taken off, so I think it's a problem with the base. I can't find any information about this online or in the user manual.

t3_9rh3ge,Pizza Dave Delivers - A Mod Review - The BAT by OBS,"  

Hello everyone, Pizza Dave here, delivering you a review of the Bat by OBS. The Bat has been on the market for a little while but seems to have gone by the way side a bit. This dual 18650 device has a max wattage of 218 watts, DOES temp control, and has some flashy lights for all you flashy lights fans out there! By today’s standards it looks bare, but it has quickly grown into one of my favorite mods to use this year (and that’s not just because it is new). Let’s dive down and see if this bat can fly! As always, I will see you down at the bottom for my final thoughts.

&#x200B;

**FEATURES**

The Bat is one of those mods that hits the market, has little flare, but makes up for it with what’s inside. On the surface it is a run of the mill 200watt (218 max) that runs on 2 18650 batteries, however, all of it is well executed. It has some flashy lights on the top and bottom of the screen, has a centered 510 pin, can handle a mm atomizer thanks to a centered 510 pin, and has a solid magnetic battery door. This is all wrapped into an ergonomic, compact mod that feels well built to top it all off.

&#x200B;

**OPERATION**

Right off the jump I had some flashbacks to my early days with a Smok Alien. The display has a very similar look to it, and the menu system is also very similar. As soon as batteries are installed, the Bat powers up with a flashy led sequence and a startup screen. 5 clicks of the fire button will lock and unlock the device. Pressing the fire button and either of the adjustment buttons will allow you to select the preheat level (soft, medium, hard). Beyond these few key combos, it is all within a scrolling menu system which is accessed by 3 clicks of the fire button. Once you get into the menu, you will press up or down to scroll through different sub menus. Long press the fire button to access each and to make selections within. It is all simple to understand and broke down to a basic level. Here is a summary of each.

&#x200B;

LIGHT – adjust the led settings or turn them off. Let’s you choose red, blue, green, yellow, purple, cyan, white, colorful, or a strobe effect of all these colors.

&#x200B;

MODE – select between wattage or temp control (ti, ni, SS)

&#x200B;

PUFFS – Puff counter and reset

&#x200B;

SETTINGS – Adjust screen brightness, timeout, perform a reset

&#x200B;

POWER – You can power the device off here if you choose to do so. 5 clicks of the fire button will bring the Bat out of the darkness

**HOW IT VAPES**

I will preface this with the face that I hardly ever use temp control. When I first received this, I used it strictly with some sub-ohm tanks I’ve been testing, but I decided I better attempt to use it in TC to give an opinion. Well I’ll be damned if it didn’t perform TC quite smoothly. It had good control of the power output, as well as a nice consistent puff every time. I even ran my tank empty to see if it would taper down. Well guess what? Who has two thumbs and didn’t get a dry hit? THIS GUY! (Pizza Dave has got extra cheese tonight)

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

This was the first mod I had heard about from OBS. They recently came out with the cube, but I had always considered them a rebuildable atomizer company only. This one surprised me, and maybe that’s why I sat here and geeked out over it for damn near this whole review. It is comfortable in the hand. I love the symmetrical design and love how it performs. There isn’t really much more to ask for in a mod.  The leds look nice and can be shut off if they aren’t your thing. It hits solid in wattage mod and performs well in temp control. I don’t have any fancy equipment to tell what it is really doing, but it “feels” like it does everything as intended. One of the only nitpicky cons I can come up with is the battery door alignment. It doesn’t fit totally flush around the edges, so there is a slight lip on the corners.  It always looks out of place, but at least it stays on solidly and has just a hair bit of movement left and right. The pros blow the cons out of the water, and this one will get a lot of use by me for quite some time.

&#x200B;

**THE OVEN TEST**

If this device went into the oven, would I go out and get another one? This is an easy yes.

Thank you all for reading this review and thank you to Sourcemore for sending it my way for review! If you would like to pick one up for yourself, it can be found for an average price of $55-60 bucks. HOWEVER, Sourcemore now has these guys selling for just $41.60, which seems like a steal to me.

t3_9rgxzq,Desire Designs X-mini Kit 2.0 - A review from the Darkcide,"Today I'll be presenting the X-mini Kit 2.0 from [Desire Design](http://www.desiredesign.com/#banner). It's a single 21700 device capable of 108 watts paired with their Bulldog sub-ohm tank. This kit was provided by Desire Designs for the purpose of review but that will not affect my ability to provide a 100% honest review. The kit is available directly from [Desire's Shopify](https://desiredesignshop.myshopify.com/products/x-mini-mod-bulldog-kits?variant=15028171210822) for $79.99 but I have yet to see it on any retailer's site. The kit is available in black, white, silver, blue, and red which  I'll be reviewing. The device and tank are also sold individually if you only want one or the other.  

Manufacturers specs:

* Battery capacity: 21700/18650
* Wattage output range: 5W-108W
* Voltage output range: 0V-8V
* Minimum resistance: 0.08Ω
* Temperature range: 200°F-600°F

The front of the package is adorned with an offset gray X that slightly wraps around to the sides and features a pic of the kit in the center of the X. In the upper right corner you'll find the individual product's names and a bunch of pictograms hinting at the device's protections right below. Both sides say Desire Designs. The top has the kit's name along with Desire's web address. The bottom has a barcode sticker which lists the kit's color along with the verification sticker. On the back you'll find the manufacturer's specs, a list of the box's contents, and the manufacturer's physical address. 

[Packaging photos](https://imgur.com/a/mpEDpSO)

Inside you'll find two tier foam packaging with and additional layer of protective foam in the top. The first level contains the X-mini in a protective plastic bag. Upon pulling out the first layer the you'll be greeted by instruction manuals for both products and a warranty/verification card with the QC pass stamp. Underneath them is the Bulldog with the 0.18Ω single mesh coil and bubble glass preinstalled along with the rest of the kit. Other than the mod and atomizer the kit also contains:

* A silicon 18650 sleeve with gold plated contact
* An extra straight glass tank
* A USB cord
* Two little transparent plastic discs that I assume are to protect the mod's paint from atomizer scratches
* An extra set of O-rings
* An additional 0.20Ω triple coil

[Inside of the box](https://imgur.com/a/pZ2akuQ)

The mod is a two piece design with a unique shape. From its name its inspiration is obviously an X but the shape is more reminiscent of a bone shaped dog biscuit to me. It's a pretty heavy mod even without the batteries. One side of the device is flat and the other is convexed in a really unique way. The flat side is a removable battery door with a large stylized X and Desire formed in it. The convexed side reminds me of a cubist sculpture with all types of bold angles everywhere. In the middle of it is a clear plastic window in the shape of the desire logo with a really well diffused bright blueish white LEDs beneath. There's a cutout in the bottom so you can easily slide your finger in and remove the battery door. You're not going to get larger than a 26mm atomizer on this device. Normally I'd be saying that you're not going to get a XXmm atomizer on the device without overhang but because of the design you're literally not going to get larger than a 26mm atomizer on it. The circular pocket where the 510 connector sits doesn't allow for it. The 510 connector has a gold plated spring loaded center pin. 

The screen, adjustment buttons, and USB port are all on the same side with the fire button sitting above them at the end of one of the X-mini's arms. It's not quite top fire yet it's not side fire...It's more 45 degree angle fire. The USB port sits in a little beveled pocket. All of the buttons are painted plastic. The buttons are the soft touch kind so they're not very clicky but they are responsive. The 0.96 inch OLED screen is crisp, bright, and visible in any lighting condition. The device feature a really nice semigloss pearlescent candy paint job giving the sandblasted zinc alloy an anodized aluminum look. However if you're OCD like me you can't help but notice the paint is a little light in the edges of the USB pocket and stamping on the battery door. Not light enough to leave the device uncoated though and it's not something you'll notice from a distance. 

The battery door fits tightly with only a little bit of a gap between it and the frame. There's not much play in it but it will slide back and forth slightly if you put your thumb on it and apply a little pressure. It's held in place by three large square magnets. The inside of the battery door is nowhere near as pretty as the exterior with the paint being kind of sparse and rough. There are apparent casting marks in the corners and top center as well. The battery strap is really thick and heavy duty featuring Desire printed in red. Both battery contacts are gold plated with the top negative contact being spring loaded. Positive and negative are clearly marked in the battery tray. 21700s fit perfectly with no play as do 18650s with the included sleeve. For the hell of it I put a 20700 in it and as expected it fits and works with a little bit of rattling. That doesn't count as a strike though because Desire doesn't market the device as 20700 compatible. They clearly state it's a 21700 device.

[Device photos](https://imgur.com/a/EJ964AT)

The Bulldog is made of stainless with color matched anodized aluminum AFC ring and fill door. Like many sub-ohm tanks it's two pieces screwed into a coil with the glass sandwiched between. The AFC ring has three grooves on each side next to large rectangular air intakes to make adjustments easy. The action on it is nice and tight but not so tight that you have to fight with it to get it to move. The top fill door slides open with the same smooth action as the AFC ring. The side you push on is knurled to not only let you know which side to slide from but also to add a little grip while you slide and the other side is smooth. The fill port beneath is a kidney shaped hole. With the bubble glass the tank holds 4.3ml of juice and with the straight glass it holds 3ml. Everything is well machined so it goes together tight and leak free. 

The tank comes with a color matched proprietary drip tip that I have to speak on for a minute. Following the trend of many drip tips now days it's made of the oh so popular snake skin resin. There is a Desire branded stainless steel band that runs along the bottom giving it the appearance of a more expensive drip tip such as those manufactured by District F5ve. However unlike the more expensive drip tips that it mimics which are made entirely of metal with a band of resin where your lips meet, the Bulldog is made entirely of resin with a band of steel for looks. So lets get to the proprietary part. It has nothing to do with the size or shape. Both the tip and opening are the standard 810 size although the opening isn't that deep. It's proprietary because the metal ring forms a groove around the circumference of the tip which sits atop a rim machined into the slider. The included tip fits nicely but you may have a bad time with others. You'll have no problem getting shallow standard size tips to fit but they won't sit flush. There's a very noticeable gap between the tip and slider like in [these photos](https://imgur.com/a/XA6NBv1) with a Relentless Mods drip tip.

[Tank photos](https://imgur.com/a/iYGv8Zy)

[Completed kit](https://imgur.com/a/iUriTwp)

The coils for this tank are big, beefy, and well packed with cotton. The .18Ω single mesh coil specs are 50-110 watts with a best range of 60-80 watts. On the mod it read as  .178Ω so the resistance listed is fairly accurate. Even though the coil has the traditional round shape it has four flat surfaces in the center forming a cube. Each face of the cube has a large juice inlet for a total of four inlets. The .20Ω triple coil specs are 80-130 watts with a best range of 100-120 watts. On the mod it reads .22Ω so once again very close. It's the standard round shape with six large juice inlets. There's also a .15Ω quad coil that I can't speak on as Desire didn't include it with the kit. 

Both of the included coils are nice but the mesh coil is the clear winner IMO. It provides a fantastic vape. Cloud and flavor on both are great with the mesh heavily leaning towards flavor and the triple leaning more towards clouds. There's no mention of material type so I'm assuming they're kanthal and didn't test them in TC mode. Both were tested using the highest VG juice that I currently have (75/25) and they both held up nicely with no dry hits or problems wicking. 

[Coil photos](https://imgur.com/a/GlVIBan)

Operation can be a bit confusing but the X-Mini offers most of the features you could want on a mod and it's updatable. I'm only going to outline features and basic operation so it's strongly advised that you fully read your manual. Five clicks of the fire button for on and off. It can be locked and unlocked by holding the left and right buttons. You can toggle between VW, NI, TI, SS, TCR, and PMG modes with three presses of the fire button and then a press of the right button. There are no preheat options in wattage mode but PMG make it pointless anyways. Gently tap left or right to adjust your wattage is increments of .1 watts or hold it to go up or down a full watt. In any of the temp modes temperature is adjusted in 10° increments. Scroll to the highest or lowest temp and then press the button again to switch back and forth between F and C. You can adjust your wattage in any of the temp modes by going back to select mode with three presses of the fire button. TCR offers three presets but toggling and setting them is a bit of a pain in the ass. You have to turn the device off first and then hold the fire and right button which brings up your TCR settings menu. From there you can select which  slot to use and set that slot's TCR value. PMG mode allows you to set your power curve across five points. Resistance is locked with a prompt when an atomizer is attached but can be reset with the atomizer attached by holding fire and right. However I was only able to get it to recheck resistance in the TC modes. The lower left portion of the screen can be switched between displaying the puff counter, puff time, or output current from select mode. The puff counter and timer are resettable by holding fire and left. If you tap the fire button four times the LED desire logo will start to slowly pulse and breathe and then four more times will make it stop. While I'm on the LED it will ramp up as you fire the device and then slowly fade when you release the fire button.

[Screen and mode photos](https://imgur.com/a/SQ1eE4p)

If you're looking for a single 21700 kit with unique styling this may be the one for you. It's styling definitely sets it apart. It's comfortable, feels solid, and performs well in both TC and wattage modes. I like the use of mixed materials on this kit. I also like when the screen's orientation is vertical like on this mod. Battery life is excellent with a 30T so I can only imagine what it must be like with a 40T. The use of mini in the title is a bit of a misnomer.  It may be mini in relation to its bigger brother but it's not a small mod by any means. There are definitely some OCD triggers for me. The lightness of paint in some spots for one. I would have liked to have seen a more consistent coating. I realize this is only in the hard to paint spots but those hard to paint spot should have probably been minimized. The USB port could have been relocated so that they didn't have to create a pocket for it and the stylized X and Desire aren't really necessary. There's enough branding without them. I guess the battery door brings me to my next trigger. It kind of bothers me that one side is convexed but the other is flat. IMO the should have gave the battery door the same cubist look as the other side. Finally even though they are close in color, I notice a difference in the shades of red of the aluminum bits of the Bulldog and the paint of the X-mini. Depending on the lighting it's more or less noticeable. 

Instead of giving you the option to make the LED breathe they should have given you the option to disable it. If you're like me you'll find the mod most comfortable thumb firing it with your right hand, palming the convexed side making the LED practically pointless. It's not visible covered by your palm. Even though the mod offers most of the features you could want in a mod, operation is kind of counterintuitive and unnecessarily complex. It could have easily been solved with a simple options menu. 

For the Bulldog I would have liked to have seen a slightly larger juice fill port. A few times pressure caused the juice to kind of flow back up while filling it so I think a bigger opening would have alleviated that. Anytime a manufacturer uses a sliding or hinged juice fill like on this tank I'd like to see some way of locking it. The Bulldog stays closed tightly but a simple latch would have added a level of reassurance that it will stay closed. There needs to be more available coil options if they're going to include it with the X-mini. Even though I'm sure most people will stick with the mesh coils I don't think the other two options are well suited for the device. With the X-mini only being capable of 108 watts having two coils that operate best over 100 watts doesn't seem that logical. You have to max your vape out just to use them. As with any sub-ohm tank I'd like to see an available RBA deck.

t3_9ren3b,New smok novo hitting harsh/burns,"Started off with a big vape and 0 Nic years ago. Didn't use it that much, too much maintenance.

Got a JUUL, used it for a year, loved the hits off it.

Got a Smok Novo yesterday, told the lady to give me juice that was close to the JUUL pods, she gave me salt Nic juice that is 50mg, she said that is about what the JUUL uses.

I also got a 40mg juice, assuming it may give bigger clouds so may want less nic.

Every hit that is JUUL sized burns my throat. (Meaning I am not trying to get hide clouds) Even if I do small ones it'll kinda burn/sting my mouth. The JUUL kinda did this when I started but got much smoother. Its been a few days and it just hurts the fuck out of my throat. Tried both juices..

Anything helps, thanks

t3_9rdf73,Help Choosing My Next Pod,"Hey guys I'm looking to get back into the pod game after quitting for 2 months. In the past I had a Kado Stealth and it was generally a good experience, but I had issues with coil QC and id like something with a draw not quite as tight. I generally do DL (considering i did that with the Kado, shouldnt be an issue with the others).


The 3 I have in mind are the Innokin EQ, Kimsun Slim 2R, and Aspire Breeze 2. I'm leaning towards the EQ but id like some perspective on a few things.

My main concerns:

Coils. I want good QC, no 1 in 3 are dead after a day BS. 

Coils are easy to find and will be for awhile. Im concerned about this since they all have new products and stuff seems to date quickly here. I've had trouble getting coils for my falcon tank and kado pods in the past.

Coil price is also something im keeping in mind, and it seems like aspire would be cheapest since you dont buy the whole pod? Which coils last longest? Id prefer not to have to change a pod twice a week. That gets expensive.

Good for a pocket/solid form factor. I loved the form of the Kado and I think id love the EQ and Aspire, and this is my main concern with the Kimsun.

Open, bigger hits. Ive hit the breeze before and loved it, but it seems like this is the biggest pro for Kimsun. I'll be using 50 nic most likely.

Also little to no leaking would be a pro. Seems like a common problem with pods.",Thu Oct 25 12:25:14 PDT 2018,coltonjg98
t3_9rddyy,Quick heads up on Humble Juice,"I've primarily been buying juice from Humble now for over a year.  Great juice, great prices, always happy.

However, they're apparently moving into a larger operation, and with that, seem to have abandoned their customers.  I placed an order on 10/9, with regular shipping.  It's 10/25, still no juice.

It took 3 emails and 2 facebook posts for them to even write back to me.  Their response was less than pleasing, to say the least.  It was a canned reply, offering a discount on the next purchase, but still no idea on when the order would be shipped.  They have not replied to my reply on that either.  (Whole thread posted).

It's great they're growing and i'm happy for them, but IMO you can't treat customers like this, especially in such a competitive market.

Will I buy again?  ~~Possibly.  Certainly not any time soon.~~    Edit: absolutely not.

The point of this is to make ya'll aware that if you order from Humble over the next few weeks, expect to wait for your juice much longer than they promise.

---

##**Appearance**

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/F65BPae)

The Naboo I received came in a brilliant rainbow colorway.  Possibly the best execution of rainbow or the heat treated metal appearance I’ve seen.  The colors are crisp and vibrant while not being too heavy on the purples or pinks.

The Naboo is nicely shaped with tapered edges and a rounded front and back panel.  Pulling it out of the package it gives the immediate impression of quality with a solid weight and tight fit and finish.  The battery door wraps around the mod and is secure.  The buttons blend in well and the touch screen buttons disappear when not in use.  This mod is on the thicker side of current dual battery mods, but it’s still easily pocket-able and easy to tote around.

The screen is large and crisp while being inset to give depth and protection from the surface screen.  There are 3 UI options to choose from.  The basic automotive gauge style dials, custom or pre-loaded wallpaper, and music mode.  Pre-loaded wallpaper has improved but is a little on the darker side.  I chose an Alligator Dark Wizard who is breathing blue fire as my background. Music mode doesn’t play music but responds to noises in the area and vaping noises.  The one downfall to it is that is constantly moves even if there is no noise, but it does move dramatically more when there is noise.

The Mesh Sub-ohm tank matches the mod nicely with similar rainbow accents. The airflow ring is nicely etched to allow easy adjustment as is the top cap for easy removal. I do wish they shared closer color hues with the mod but that’s quite minor.  The coils for the tank have massive triangle wick ports that are sure to gobble up the juice.  The drip tip is probably my least favorite part because it’s very primary color focused and just doesn’t fit the bright rainbow style.  It is a nice tip though and outside of matching just right I have no complaints about it.


---

**Function**

**How it Works** -  5 quick fire button presses turns the mod off or on.  Accessing the menu is done via 3 fire button presses.  After that you need to use the hidden touch buttons to navigate around and a long press of the fire button will back out of menus.  The menu system is the same from the Charon Mini.  You have the VW mode which has options for preheat and a VW curve mode.  TC mode has presets for SS, Ni, Ti, TCR, and a TC Curve mode if you’re ambitious.  The settings allow you to change brightness, time, display, screensaver, factory reset, and vibration mode.  The wallpaper mode gives you a choice of different wallpaper preset options and there is a firmware update program that will allow you to upload custom wallpaper similar to the Charon Mini. (http://smoant.com/datas-download.html)

Two key new features here are the lock/unlock button and vibration mode.  The lock/unlock button, located just below the fire button turns off and on the touch adjustment buttons.  You can vaguely see the outline of their swirly shape when off but they’re mostly hidden on the front screen when turned off.  A feature I really wanted on the Charon Mini was the ability to turn off the screen.  I am so happy they included this on this mod.  You just have to hold the lock/unlock button for a couple seconds until it vibrates and the screen will turn off but you can continue using the mod.  Helpful when watching a movie or driving in the dark, or just to save some battery life.

The vibration mode adds a tactile function to the mod when adjusting wattage or temperature.  It seems unnecessary at first but I actually ended up liking it a lot.  It bridges the gap between an actual button press and a touch screen.  You can feel the small adjustments and don’t need to put eyes on the mod when making them.

**How it Vapes** - The mesh subohm tank is pretty solid.  The wick holes are large but I was able to vape this pretty much dry before getting a burnt flavor.  Flavor is above average in my experience.  Not quite Mesh Pro territory but better than most for sure.  I put right at 210ml (120ml, 60ml, 30ml) through my first coil before it started slightly tasting funky which may have been partially because of the 3 different flavors.  My second coil is at 150ml and still going strong.  Airflow is on point and smooth.  Top cap is easy to remove but slightly difficult to put back on until you catch the threading just right.  I have been quite pleased with this included subohm tank.

As usual with Smoant chips the mod fires quickly even in normal or minimal mode.  It is a joy to use.  TC mode is decent with the SS setting.  I only tried the SS setting and TCR.  To adjust the wattage you kind of have to press the fire button and an adjustment button at the same time.  The default adjustment is temperature.  The preset for SS worked well in my opinion.  It was consistent and did not have a lot of pulsing using the SS coils in the Mesh Pro tank.  I primarily use VW mode on normal and it's just an excellent experience.  I'm never feeling like it needs to fire faster or that it doesn't respond to my presses.  In fact the fire button is easy to locate without looking as well.

---

**Pros**

* Solid build quality
* Excellent fit and finish
* Fast firing
* Can turn adjustment buttons off
* Can turn screen off
* Vibration feedback
* 3 UI options
* Good flavor
* Long lasting coils

**Cons**

* Rainbow is a fingerprint Magnet
* On the heavier side
* Sometimes hard and messy to put tank top cap on.

---

**Summary**

I try to be pretty picky about things or at least point out potential flaws but this mod kit seems quite excellent. The addition of the hide-away touch screen buttons and the ability to turn off the screen make me very happy.  It feels extremely solid with excellent style, fit, and finish.  It fires fast, makes with the vapors, and has custom wallpaper.  Lastly the included subohm tank is actually pretty solid unlike most kits.  It has good flavor, good coil longevity and the top won’t accidentally open in your pocket.  The Naboo exceeded my expectations and continues to do so.  I can’t really ask for anything more or different and the cons I listed are more minor inconveniences than anything else.  I want another one of these in Green very badly.

---

The Smoant Naboo is available in Red, Green, Blue, Rainbow, Black, SS, Pink, and and can be purchased for between $45-$60 depending on if you want the tank.

t3_9rcrwl,"Do any other ""advanced"" Vapers feel out of the loop?","Okay to start off with , I am using ""advanced"" subjectively here...

For instance, I myself started with the ego sticks(there was a brief period where I tried the cig-a-likes but I will skip that), then moved onto a box mod with a tank for the advantage of less refills and more battery. Then I moved on to an even bigger box mod with an RTA and on to squonks and RDAs. 

In that time I have also learned to wrap coils and make juices. 

That's my history, and in each step there has been ~18 month in between. Every time I have to buy a new mod I have had to relearn what is the latest and mod and techniques whenever I am in the market for an upgrade.

I can truthfully say that I have been making my own juice and wrapping my own coils whilst sucking on a squonk but looking around for a new device this last week I have realised I am so detached from what is current in vaping that I may as well be starting all over again.

##Exceed NC Battery Rundown and Performance

The Exceed NC battery is a somewhat adjustable simple stick with a fire button and nothing else. There is an LED inside the fire button that is only white or orange. It tell you the battery level by how fast it flashes 60% or more battery and ti stays lit, 30-59% and it flashes slowly, 10-29% it flashes moderately, and less than 10% it flashes quickly. That needs to be better done IMO but at least it’s somewhat of a battery meter. If it flashes fast time to charge it. As far as adjustable goes it has 2 output modes like the vandy vape berserker MTL kit. To switch modes turn the device off (5 clicks) then hold fire. It’ll switch back and forth. White is direct output while orange is consistent output mode. But i’ll go over that in  bit.

The stick itself is really nice. There is not much of a design it’s just a basic stick with some lines cut into it for a little style but nothing too gaudy. The coloring is beautiful as well and looks like a nice clear coat on it giving it a semi-gloss finish. It can handle a 22 mm atomizer without overhang which is the size of the notchcore tank and makes it have an AIO type look to it.  It feels well built and is all metal, but it’s also really light. The USB port is on the back but they don’t list an amp limit.


Performance of the stick was subpar. I reviewed the iJust 3 and was very disappointed in it. The Cascade one plus and voopoo caliber performed great however. Compared to those 3 the exceed NC performs not very good. They list a resistance limit of .3 ohms minimum. I was able to fire a .2ohm however but my .15 ohm wouldn’t fire so the real limit is somewhere between .15 and .2 ohms. Which is fine for the tank since the included coils are .45 ohm SS304 notch coils. 


With a .2 ohm coil i got 57 watts of smooth output (17 amps, 3.366 volts), which is a step down from the cascade one plus and caliber sticks. The output was the same for both modes. With a .63 ohm coil I got 24 watts and 3.892 volts in direct output mode which again is a step below the others. In constant output mode it couldn’t provide an actual output and just hunted voltage. It doesn't really work well in constant output mode as it should making the mode useless and best used in direct output mode. Overall not a good performer.


##Notchcore Tank performance

I’m not going to get into detail about the tank itself since i’ve already reviewed it before but a few quick specs on it. Uses an 510 drip tip and comes with a black delrin one, 2.5ml capacity. Uses a slide back to fill method. My main focus on this will be how does the tank perform with the exceed NC battery.

It comes with 2 coils, but both are the same and only coil for the tank which is a notch coil made of SS304 and is rewickable as well. The silk kit i reviewed with this tank (which is what review to check out more on the tank) came with 5 coils. They are pretty cheap so can’t complain too much but including a extra pack of 4 would have been nice. With that said I did really like the tank in the silk kit. It is a good tank for low watt DTL vaping and probably the best for that less than 30 watts. It was also a decent loose MTL tank with the air closed down and under 20 watts. However with this kit it just doesn't seem to perform as it should. It’s not enough power to DTL and get the full potential of the tank but too much power to MTL on. Overall it’s a good tank but performs much better with an adjustable mod and doesn't work well in this kit with the exceed NC battery.


##Pros: 
 
* Build Quality of mod and tank
* Size and Weight for portability
* Simple Sleek Design
* Battery Life (2300mah battery)
* AFC is easy to adjust and smooth
* Standard 510 tip
* Easy to refill 
* Decent Battery Indicator
* Passthrough vaping





##Cons: 
 

* LED is dim
* coils do not match the output of the battery
* weak muted flavor from coils
* Lack of Color Options
* small 2.5ml capacity
* poor performance from the battery
* constant output mode doesn’t work correctly



##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this kit or not? I don’t like to do a hard yes or no, but this is going to lean towards the no pretty heavily. The battery itself just doesn’t perform well and the Coils for the tank aren't designed well enough to work with the battery. The tank itself is still good and is on my list so it’s worth it for a low watt under 30 watts DTL tank to pair with an adjustable mod but the kit itself is not worth buying and won’t be going on my list.


This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

t3_9rconp,Help with new mod for no overhang with Mesh Pro tank,"I'm looking to get a new mod that won't the Mesh Pro tank won't overhang on.  Any suggestions?

I'm guessing it would require a mod that takes 30 mm tanks with no overhang.  Problem is, I see on Anthony Vape's list that there only seem to be a couple total saying they take 30 mm.  

I break shit too much to get an SG mini.  Does that pretty much leave the Smoant Cylon (not my favorite for looks).  I'm not loving the sliding panels on the voopoo too.  It seems like a pretty thin market for mods that can handle this tank with no overhang.

t3_9rcl9h,Fireluke Mesh Pro Coil recommendation,"After intensive testing i came to a conclusion. Be advised that its very subjective, but after testing most of the best rated RTA's and Prebuilds, i came to the conclusion that the Mesh Pro beats them all.




* **Single mesh 0.15-ohm Kanthal (included): Rated for 40 to 70 watts.**

>Skip, honestly. The flavour isn't great and the Wattage to fire this thing is on pair with the Triple Coil. Tastes a bit flat.

* **Double mesh 0.2-ohm Kanthal (included): Rated for 60 to 90 watts.**

>Absolute favorite, it has a very sweet and moist taste, everything tastes very soft and the coil does not get warm at all. I vaped at 55 Watt's with 6mg 50:50. Absolutely good, it removed the main concern i had with most other TA's. The flat flavour after some time, and the dry vape. Its awesome, absolute best of all three.


* **Triple mesh 0.15-ohm Kanthal: Rated for 80 to 110 watts**

>It's also good. But only for people who like more dry clouds. The flavour comes trough very good. But it gets warm after some time. I was vaping at 70 Watts. It outputs lots of vapour which was not really pleasant to me. But thats due the high input it requires. I guess its for people who like the Uwell Crown/Valyrian, because i find them also pretty dry. I have friends who like that taste because they vape without nicotine. But for someone who was a smoker before, i rather take the big hit and then stop vaping than to dry my tank in half an hour. And the flash is simply more intense if your Liquid tastes more splashy and cool (in terms of temperature).",Thu Oct 25 10:50:43 PDT 2018,Adidas_Hardbass

t3_9rbtbx,"I'm sick of terrible, expensive mods.","EDIT: Thank you all for your thoughtful responses. After reading Anthony's reviews and some digging on google and soul-searching – I ordered the Lost Vape Paranormal DNA 250C. 

I now understand what is actually decently expensive for a mod, and I'm willing to invest rather than keep throwing away money on trash box mods.

&#x200B;

I've had awful experiences with the following mods:• **VFENG** \- the best by far, except SS316 mode produces weak vape. Ran in low temp on Ni200 mode for a year. Gave it to my SO• **Drag** \- Screen backlight died for no reason, no damage whatsoever• **WYE 200w** \- Tried to charge over USB (*which is supported and even* ***touted by Teslacigs as a feature***) No longer reads battery. I would buy this again possibly.• **USV Mach ON3** \- RSA wire screw holes are loose and stretched out, no longer holds wires steadily. Sub-ohm TC is awful• Just purchased yesterday: **Reuleaux RX Gen3** \- Kicks me out of TC and back into power mode. Rebuilt twice. dual coils, 10-wrap 24g 3.0 ID SS316L 2.8 ohms. Updated the firmware. Unscrew/fire rescrew/fired the RDA. Everything is clean and tight and brand new. This is apparently a recurring RX problem w/ SS - all over the web.

I'm absolutely over all this bullshit. I've spent hundreds of dollars on these devices and every last one of them has some kind of problem within less than 4 months.

&#x200B;

All that being said, can anyone recommend a solid, long-term TC mod that works with SS316L on the dead rabbit RDA? I want personal testaments to build quality, TC stability, and longevity.

I'm going back to the B&M store I bought the Reuleaux from and getting a refund today. The only thing I'd consider buying again is the WYE because it was phenomenal besides the USB charging (which, after writing it out now, is ***actually*** preposterous)

I'm using 24mg nic salt with the suggested 1.2 coil.  I tried the 0.6 coil, and it was too harsh and then read later that with salt you should use the 1.2.    All of a sudden now though the MTL hit is super harsh and is making me cough like crazy.  It also is not tasting as good as a DTL hit (or a restricted dtl, i guess with this device).   I'm very new to all of this and coming off smoking for 30yrs.  My taste buds are screaming at all the good flavors now too.  I was stuck on a virginia tobacco flavor purely and now it's just gross.   It's like all of a sudden I cannot stand to draw into my mouth and then inhale.  I'm going straight to the lung and it's hitting way better.  Is this normal?  Am I just finding my sweet spot?

I’m not all that interested in cool new features and capabilities, I’m a pretty basic vaper. I Vape to keep me off cigarettes so I have very basic requirements. I don’t use TC, I Vape at around 35-50 watt on a Aspire Cleito tank. I need a reliable, well built mod that is easy to use and consistent with good battery life. I’m planning on getting a dual battery mod. These are the mods I’ve been looking at.

1) Innokin Proton

2)Vaporesso- Either the Revenger or the Revenger X. I’m leaning toward the Revenger only because I don’t need to spend more for a newer version with features I won’t be using anyway. 

3)Vaporesso Polar

4) Vaporesso Switcher

5)Smoant Charon

Vaperesso Estoc tank  (on the go)
EUC coil 0.4ohm  

Now the only thing I need is a mod. I will use the vape at around 35watts to 60watts. A heard(so looking for confirmation) that I should buy an 80-120watt mod, otherwise I'll be using the mod to his max which is not good for battery life and heat.
I think I can choose my own mod (will take recommendations tho) but I mainly want my setup to be confirmed and maybe get some more advice if there is something I missed.

t3_9r7g0t,Looking for some assistance.,"**TL;DR: Another Mod Recommendation Thread**

\------------------------------------------------

Firstly, a little background:

&#x200B;

I'm not exactly new to the vaping scene.  Like many of you, I'm sure, I first started vaping around 5 or 6 years ago, when the eGo Twist was still a fairly new mod, and extremely popular for people making the switch to vaping.  I was fascinated, and eventually moved on to the first iTaste MVP2/Nautilus type setups, and later into stuff like Sigelei 100's, Tugboats, the first Subtanks -- you know the drill.

&#x200B;

However, vaping was mostly a hobby for me. I never *really* stopped smoking, at all, in the last 15 years or so. I eventually gave my entire vape collection away to a very close friend, and continued smoking my Camel 99's for the next few years.

&#x200B;

Then, about a month ago, I picked up the JUUL, and fell in love all over again.  It was great, I loved the simplicity of it all. I immediately stopped smoking cigarettes entirely.  Then, the honeymoon phase ended about a week later, and I started growing tired of the inconsistency of the pod quality, the battery life, and the overall vaping experience of it all. I did my best to bear with it, and do some Google-Fu for another week or two.  I first looked to all of the YouTube channels I used to watch -- people like GrimmGreen, RiP Trippers, and IndoorSmokers.

&#x200B;

Thinking I had finally done enough research, I went to pick up a Joyetech Penguin and some juice, hearing about it's decent mtl capabilities -- and was immediately disappointed. It had a constant gurgle, and I went through an embarrassing number of coils, bought different ratio/nic level juice, the whole nine yards to try to get it to taste like the juice, and not burnt cotton.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm coming to you guys looking for a mod suggestion, as I feel that a lot of the vape channels on YT are sponsored reviews, and will always receive a positive review.  What I'm looking for is a reliable (prefer MTL, but DL is okay too) setup, with no muss or fuss, or super flashy. I'm not really into winning cloud comps, or vaping as a hobby anymore.  I just wanna get my nicotine fix, and have a decent experience.

&#x200B;

t3_9r6fdk,Better tank for Vaporesso Polar kit?,"Hi,

Im just getting into vaping and Im having great success in getting off the cigs. So far I have purchased a Vaporesso Cascade One kit & the Vaporesso Polar kit. The only issue I have with these is they tend to leak slightly.

This isn't too much of a problem but I've ordered some expensive CBD juice which I don't want to loose to leakage. 

Can I buy say the Innokin Zenith and use it on my mods and with the Vaporesso coils? Would there be a better product to buy?

Also the CBD juice maker says I need to use a 5V vape, is the cascade / polar capable of this?

Thanks!",Wed Oct 24 19:51:50 PDT 2018,Maurice_M0ss

t3_9r66my,PIZZA DAVE DELIVERS - AN RDA REVIEW - THE ETNA BY DIGIFLAVOR,"**INTRODUCTION**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Hello everyone Pizza Dave here, delivering a review of the Etna by Digiflavor. The Etna is the latest rda released by Digiflavor and if you are an MTL vapor, this one will be right up your alley. The Etna is a single coil, 18mm rda, which utilizes removable air flow adjustment blocks. It was designed by Giuseppe Pappalardo and Salvatore Agrosì out of Italy and is a collaboration between them and Digiflavor. I don’t have a clue who these guys are, but they seem to know what they are doing. Without further a due, let’s dive down and look at the Etna, and as always, I will give you my final thoughts down at the bottom.

&#x200B;

DISCLAIMER: This rda was sent to me by Heaven Gifts for review.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**WHAT YOU GET**

* 1 Digiflavor ETNA rda
* 1 Short, clear 510 drip tip
* 1 Longer, clear 510 drip tip
* 1 clear drip tip heat guard
* 1 clear beauty ring
* 3 Air flow blocks
* 3 Feather Cotton (agletted on the ends for easy wicking)
* 6 random coils (I MEAN RANDOM, THEY DON’T EVEN SAY WHAT THEY ARE!)
* 1 Spare parts bag
* 1 BF pin
* 1 Allen wrench for the air flow blocks
* 1 T handle tool for coils
* 1 Manual

Available in Gold, Silver, Black, Gunmetal, Blue, and Rainbow

&#x200B;

**BUILD DECK AND WICKING**

The build deck on this rda is nothing new or fancy. It features offset posts, like the ones on the Pixie RDA which I recently reviewed. The backsides of the posts are open, so the coils can be snipped after they are set. This one doesn’t offer a ton of room between the posts and the top cap, so make sure to snip them close to the deck or you will have some shorts going on. There are notches on the deck which show the best location for the coils. My placement of choice was to line up with the notches and lift the coil, so it has just a small gap between the coil and the airflow block. Wicking on this is a breeze. All you must do is tuck the cotton down along the sides and …boom…done. If you are squonking, make sure you keep the cotton in the outer channels and it will squonk best this way.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**AIR FLOW**

Air flow is where the ETNA gets a bit tricky. There is NO air flow adjustment via the top cap. To adjust air flow, you have to change some tiny little blocks on the deck. These blocks are held in place by a large gold-plated Allen key which is hollow and serves as an air inlet. I don’t like this design, as these can’t be changed with a coil in.  They are also a bit of a pain to set. I ended up using tweezers to hold them in place each time, but still managed to drop them and curse….a handful of times.  I elected to install each block to see which one felt right for me without a coil in and take some pulls from it until it felt right for me.  The air flow between all three are not that different from one another in terms of the tightness of the draw, especially the single large hole and the 3 smaller holes. The one with 2 holes is the tightest of the lot. I dove into the 3 hole as I felt it would disperse the air flow across the surface of the coil for maximum flavor. In my opinion, I was right, and this was my preferred setting after trying the others. It isn’t super tight, but it is not a loose draw either. This doesn’t have the range of adjustment as seen with other mtl rdas I have tried lately, but what it provides is the draw I prefer so I am okay with it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**HOW IT VAPES**

In short, the vape from this is incredible if you enjoy mtl vaping. The flavor is top notch and the draw is super smooth. I don’t like the removable block thing because it makes fine tuning a total pain in the ass, but once you find that sweet spot, at least you don’t have to touch it any more. I ran this with some of the stock coils (.8 and .9-ohms on average) as well a SS316 round build that was around .5 and it worked well with each. One great thing about vaping this is the low wattage you can run to achieve a good vape. I set it anywhere from 20-35 watts and it makes for a great all day vape without chugging juice and batteries.

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

The Italians and Digiflavor put out a formidable entry to the mtl market with this one. I can stand behind it for all you mtl vapors out there. The only major con I can think of is the air flow block situation. It doesn’t allow for a ton of fine tuning and isn’t convenient in any way. However, the pros outweigh the cons for sure. It is simple, yet stylish. It has smooth air flow. The build deck is easy to work on. The squonking action is superb (just be mindful of the small chamber or you can overdrip/oversquonk). Another pro is the price point. The bottom line with this one is…. If you are an mtl vapor looking for a rebuildable rda, then this one is worth a look.

&#x200B;

**OVEN TEST**

If this rda were to accidentally go into the pizza oven would I go out and get another? Yes. Simple as that.

&#x200B;

**PROS**

* Great flavor
* Sips liquid
* Easy to build
* Easy to wick
* Smooth air flow
* Comes with lots of accessories

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**CONS**

* Must remove blocks to adjust air flow
* Came with a bag of random coils with no markings. I would want to know the material as well as resistance going in. It is just super random and seems like a last minute “gift”
* Can get pretty warm when chain vaping (lip protector gets a pro for this con)

REVIEW CRITERIA: I use each item extensively for about two weeks to ensure I have collected enough data to adequately write a review. I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used all products enough to give an educated review. The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying them and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \*\*\*\*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.",Wed Oct 24 19:18:37 PDT 2018,pizzadave80

After lurking here for a month you guys are posting actual articles that made me stick with it. I hate to be cheesy but you guys saved my life if not at least gave me a few more years. I Love this sub, I've told all my smoker friends about how vaping will work and they are trying it!  After seeing me quit I think they see the light.

t3_9r3ubx,Help with first mod purchase,"Hello y'all! Well, three weeks ago, my wife secretly ordered me a little vape pen. I had smoked for more than twenty years, at least two packs a day. I haven't smoked a half of a pack since I started to vape.

Now, I've got two little pod systems, the Panda which I do like, but the pods always leak, no matter how new they are...

And the Renovo zero system, I ordered pods for this one but haven't received them yet.

I am looking for a simple mod, nothing fancy, don't really need dual batteries but it would be great. I don't want to drip, or squonk, so a tank, I guess?

I'm also a poor MoFo with very little expendable cash flow, I was smoking rollies if that helps to show my budget...

I need to get in way under a hundred bucks, and just don't k ow what to look at or what to get. I'm okay with prebuilt coils, and don't really want to get into building my own yet. All the reviews and everything here are excellent, honestly, but I still do not know what I even need. 

I like the draw from the pod systems, but could do with a little better vapor production. I guess I want a DTL, because hats how I've been vaping...I'm just lost guys, and need some solid suggestions on what would work, for a budget. Thing is, I don't want to order from China, and wait six or eight weeks for it to get here, so that hurts my budget options a lot, I know. I also know if my current pen atomizer dies, and I don't have a new mod I will start smoking again.

What should I look for?

I don't need fancy displays, simple led lights are fine by me.

I don't need fancy looks, I'm a mechanic so things won't stay ""*pretty*"" for long anyway....

t3_9r3hq8,Shout out to Dangerouswomanlabs and a review!,"I'm not sure if I should flair this a review or positivity, because it is very much both...... (I decided on positivity)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok so a little back story here....During Mod-Pocalypse, as I'm calling it, that went down here on ECR it just so happend to be my cake day.  Needless to say I was a bit more than bummed to see my beloved sub in such turmoil and I was having a bad day anyways. In reply to one of my comments u/dangerouswomanlabs popped in and offered to send me some juice to make my day better!  I thought this was pretty awesome of them, so I sent a PM and we started talking.  I checked their site and told them the flavors I liked etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We PM'd a bit and needless to say DWL's sense of humor is off the chart!  So we started up a pretty witty rapport.  A few days go by and I get a message that it will be shipping soon.  A few more days and then another message.  So, long story short, DWL  ended up needed some major surgery which caused even further delays.  He was beyond apologetic and said he'd be adding more to the package the longer it took.  We PM'd a lot over the last month, I checked up on his recovery, etc, and the his sense of humor just made my day with every message I received.  I obviously could care less how long an offering of free juice took to get to me so I assured him it was no big deal every step of the way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, the box show's up last night.............and this is not what I expected in the slightest! You wanna talk about going above and beyond?!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Check this out!

&#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/a/MJGRC3I](https://imgur.com/a/MJGRC3I)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So just a quick side note here, DWL is also an artist and drew all of their site and label artwork.  The framed image inside is a hand painted original, the photo does not do it justice!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Needless to say I was completely blown away by all of this, the generosity here is unreal!  So I thought he deserved some ECR love and the least I could do was throw up a quick juice review!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Without further ado let's get on to that part!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the box I received 3 x 100ml bottles:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Amelia, the flavor description is berries, cream and cake and it is spot on!  The berry notes hit your nose as soon as you open the bottle and man does it smell good!  So I built and wicked my new BTFC (see album) to get to tasting!   This flavor has a nice clean berry up front but very creaming with the cake in back round, it's not overly sweet and the berry isn't overpowering either, just a really well balanced juice.  This is a killer desert flavor, so if this sounds like your jam it's a must try!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Next we have Harriet, an Irish Coffee.  This one has that somewhat typical cream aroma when you first smell it, but after loading up my RDA it's a completely different story, it's a nice mellow irish cream and the coffee notes hit you at the end.  Overall extremely well done!  It's not a punch you in the face coffee, the juice isn't dark so it's not an instant coil killer.  I am a huge coffee drinker so this one was right up my alley!  If you like smooth creamy coffee flavors this is up there with the best of them!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And last we have Annie, Apple Pie, Cinnamon, Caramel and nuts!  Another killer baked good!  I would say a nice cross between an apple pie and an apple fritter with a hint of caramel!  The description is spot on, all the notes are there and really well balanced!  Apple pie up front with that hint of cinnamon and the caramel and nut kicks in, this is flat out delicious!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So there we go!  My quick down and dirty juice review!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just an FYI my BTCF build is dual twisted 24 awg coming in at .20 ohm and running on a Charon Mini at 52.5 watts with the bottom airflow all the way open and the top airflow just a crack (I found letting just a tiny bit of air through the top airflow really helped the flavors pop!)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I haven't heard much about Dangerous Woman Labs around these parts so give these guys some love!  They make a great product for sure! They have 7 flavors in total and each of the ones I've tried are very very well done!  I appreciate that there are still makers out there that keep their line limited and focus on quality!

t3_9r3eqq,Do RTA's burn faster than pre built atomizers?,"I've only just recently started building for the first time with siren 2 and I'm noticing that my cotton needs replacing and coil gets really gunked up much faster than when I was using pre built coils.

İ used to use the innokin zenith and also nautilus aspire and the coil would last me 3-4 weeks, but now with the same juice I'm needing to replace my cotton and dry burn my coil once a week in the siren 2 at least, because the bit of the cotton which touches the coil is black with a lot of build up which naturally give me a burnt taste.

I'm using kanthal 26 gauge which gives me approx 1 ohm, vaping at about 15.5w. I vape the 0.8ohm zenith on 16.5 and that gives me at least 3-4 weeks. 

İs this normal or am I vaping on too high a wattage? Or could it be that RTA's wick differently to pre built ones and I'm not giving it enough time to soak? I'm not vaping any differently than I was before though.

I got my Innokin Endura T20-S on Monday and I've been vaping Melonlyptus from BX ever since. (Totally in love with this flavor and didn't expect to find one I like so quickly!!) The problem is that I ordered a Menthol sampler from BlueDot which arrived today and I realized that I never set the nicotine level, so it is 0. I wasn't sure how to word this for a search, so apologies if this has been asked. Should I order a flavorless juice and mix them or would I be better off ordering another batch of the same sampler, setting the nic level higher, and then mixing the two?

t3_9r3cpc,Falcon Tank Suddenly Using Bunch of Juice,"Hello all,


As the title states, my Falcon tank is suddenly going through a lot of juice and I am trying to pinpoint the cause. Normally I go through 1 bottle of 60mL juice a week, filling up my tank about twice a day.  Now I feel like I'm filling up any time I come back to my vape after setting it down for a bit. 


Last Friday I dropped my vape and busted it all up. Luckily I had all the parts to fix it (new glass/coil/mouthpiece) etc. I even changed a few gaskets that were worn down. It did take me from the curved glass the Falcon comes with to its replacement, which is straight. This is the only change as I track my puffs and that has stayed steady over the past few months. 

Specs:

SMOK X-Cube Ultra

Falcon subohm tank with M1 mesh coils

Normal juice = Pacha Mama (except for the Blood Orange flavor) 


Also, just now after filling my tank I came back after a few moments and it was leaking out of the airflow. This might have just been human error but I've had this tank for awhile and don't feel like I'd mess up and put it in the central tube. Other than the occasional drip-drops, this is the first time it has LEAKED out of the airflows. 

Thanks to anyone who can help!",Wed Oct 24 13:24:11 PDT 2018,Mr_BunBun

- I was able to save my battlestar and uwell crown 3, and all my juice. All my rdas, and 2 other mods (aspire archon which I loved, and a fuchai 213w mini which was meh) are toast. 

- I usually vape at 100w or less

- here’s the kicker: I don’t need no TC, or touchscreen, or joysticks, or feather ticklers, or any other nonsense. Straight up wattage mode, simple setups. 

I might just get another battlestar, but what’s the fun in that?

On the GT 4 I get between 0,41 and 0,45 ohm usually between 0,41-0,43.

I purchased the kit used and I would like to know if those readings are within the margins of error.

I screwed on the tank pretty tied a few times and I got higher ohm ratings in that case with both coils. Apart from those few tries I only screw my tank so tight that it just sits properly/tight. How tight am I supposed to screw the tank?",Wed Oct 24 11:53:44 PDT 2018,Christi123321

t3_9r1pv0,Anthony Vapes: 3Cvape Sahara RDA Review,"Hi All, Anthony Vapes back here with my review of the 3Cvape Sahara RDA, please see the bottom for disclaimers and links. Note: This is not marked as a sample version 


##Introduction:
 
 
The Sahara RDA is the latest RDAs from pretty new vape manufacturer 3Cvape. They came onto the scene in 2017 with the conspiracy RDA I reviewed which was great, and in 2018 made the Savour MTL RTA which is a great MTL RTA and that’s all i’m aware of that they’ve done so far so 2 for 2 in my book. The Sahara 2 is a dual coil DTL RDA with an included squonk pin and designed in collaboration with vape geek q8 who i never heard of but after looking him up seems to be a small time youtube reviewer who started doing reviews about a year ago. It’s available in 2 colors Silver/acrylic and Black/ultem. Looking around online i see it in the 30USD range and elementvape has them for 27.95 so very good price point.

##Initial Impressions
 
When I first got this RDA I was pretty disturbed at the design. It’s basically a phobia V2 RDA but instead of using a great postless deck they copied the deck from the engine 2 RTA which was one of the worst RTAs made this year. I didn’t get it at all. Not that the deck is hard to build on but it’s a whole lot of extra deck for no reason and there are much better decks to copy. It’s almost as if the designer said take the phobia V2 and throw the engine 2 deck in there instead. Really just a poor idea and just adds to the large amount of questionable design choices I’ve seen from reviewer collaboration products. Especially from a smaller one that isn’t going to sell on name alone, you’d think they would want to create something unique and good to build their popularity but it seems rarely the case. Anyway overall wasn’t very impressed from the start at all.


 
##Build Deck and Wicking (pics above)
 
Let’s talk about the build deck now. Since they copied the engine 2 RTA deck i’ll just copy and paste my explanation from that deck and make necessary updates. It’s an interesting one. If i had to describe it in a simple way i’d call it an upside down postless deck where you don’t need to precut leads. That’s essentially how it works. It’s a 2 post deck that’s built up high and your coils go in upside down from most RTAs with the leads facing up. Each lead gets its own screw and coils can be installed one at a time. When you are done it’s easy to clip the excess leads of the top as well. It’s an extremely easy to build on deck. Just place your coil to the height you want it and screw in the leads then clip the excess. The deck and airflow with it does leave very limited options though as far as coils size. You also can’t position the coils either much so i recommend using a 3mm max. You are limited in your wraps as well with the negative and positive being very close together but it’s more room then the engine 2 RTA deck due to being an RDA and not a RTA so slightly bigger. The post screws are a good enough quality flat head/phillips combo screw though and better than the ones on the engine 2 RTA. Overall a slightly improved version of the engine 2 RTA deck.


Wicking on it is quite easy. It’s an RDA so nothing fancy just drop your leads to the bottom. 


##Performance

Performance wise, I used it as a Dual Coil RDA only as intended no way to really run a single coil effectively anyway. I ran 4 builds in this a fancy 3mm ID build, a fancy 3.5 mm ID build, a fancy 4mm ID build and 1 simple round 3mm ID build. For size I found it worked best with the 3mm ID. the 4mm ID was a really tight squeeze and due to the deck you can’t really get air under it well as you can’t raise up the coil so i’d stick to 3mm ID personally and as many wraps as you can fit comfortably in it. The flavor isn’t much with a simple round build and still just mediocre at best with a fancy build. Overall not a bad performer but pretty mediocre and outclassed by many other RDAs on the market currently and very build limited.  

 
##Overall Impressions, Details, and Extras
 
Let’s talk about the airflow now. It has side airflow with 4 good sized round holes angled down on each side that you close off by spinning the top part of the top cap as it’s a 2 piece top cap. Here is where they fixed an issue with the phobia 2 through. The phobia 2 didn’t allow for much adjustment but the sahara allows you to close off 1 hole at a time so well done there and how the phobia 2 should have been. The top cap o-rings are good and it’s easy to pop off and on both parts of it. There is also a stopper so it lines up the air and locks the bottom part into place like the phobia 2 should have been and it’s easy to screw on and off your mod as well. 


 It comes with 1 standard 810 friction fit drip tip which on the black one i have is an ultem one with a metal ring on it. The SS version has a clear PMMA looking one from the pics. It also worked well with other 810 tips i’ve tried including friction fit ones and o-ring ones as well so you should be able to use others you have with no issues. It does not come with a 510 adapter so no 510 option unless you already have an adapter. The Drip tip fits very well in the RDA. snug, not loose, not tight. The quality on the 3cvape Sahara RDA is quite nice as well. The o-rings for the top cap onto the base feel right and the top cap is snug but not tight. Very easy to take apart with no issues. The AFC is easy to adjust on or off a mod even with nothing for grip, the o-rings fit just right and everything is nicely done. The top cap does lock into place so also easy to get on and off mods. The post screws are good quality as well and 4 spare screws are included all are flathead/phillips combo screws. It comes with a standard 510 pin and a BF 510 pin like most RDAs these days as well. 

The juice well is a good size. Not massive but pretty large. The over squonk protection and Over drip protection is pretty good. The side airflow is high enough up that it doesn't cause any issues leaking when dripping or squonking. I only used it as a dripper as i’m not currently working on a review for any squonk mods but i did put it on a squonk mod just to test it real quick and it worked well. As a dripper you can drip right down the drip tip without taking off the top cap. You can basically flood the coils and it won’t leak in normal usage since the coils sit low and the airflow is higher up but be careful not to because nobody likes to vape a coil sitting in ejuice. It would be better if the coils sat up more but due to the deck they can’t

It’s a 24mm diameter so should not overhang on most mods on the market today. There is plenty of spare o-rings and 4 spare post screws  for it, 1 screwdrivers, no 510 tip adapter, no coils, and no cotton however. Pretty bare amount of accessories which was a little disappointing. They should have included a 510 tip or an extra 810 tip as well as a 510 adapter. Also some coils and cotton would have been nice but not a big deal. Branding is pretty nice mostly. Nothing major however on the metal part of the o-ring the reviewer has his initials on it. That’s a bit tacky to me personally and shouldn’t be there. Keep your name on the box and the bottom of the RDA only not on the outside. Thankfully it’s not in your face so not to bad.


##Pros: 
 
* standard 810 tip (ultem or PMMA depending on color choice)
* standard 510 pin and squonk pin included
* plenty of spare o-rings
* good quality flathead/phillips combo screws post screws 
* Good over squonk protection
* works well as a dripper or squonker
* simple looks and branding mostly
* build deck is easy to build on
* nice size juice well
* good build quality
* Price point (under 30 USD)
* top cap locks into place
* AFC easy to adjust 




 
##Cons:
 
* no included coils or cotton
* only 1 tip included
* overall lack of standard accessories
* don’t like the build deck and it’s limiting on coil position and size
* flavor is mediocre
* lack of color options

 
##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this RDA?I don’t like to do a hard yes or no, but this one will lean towards the no. It’s a shame since their 1st 2 atomizers were really good but now they took a deck i didn’t care for and paired it with the design of a good RDA but missed a lot of what made the phobia 2 good to begin with. They did correct a few flaws of it like the AFC adjustment and adding in the notches to lock the cap in place, but the postless deck was a big reason the phobia 2 was good in the 1st place and with this deck and the way the airflow is you can easily flood a coil and the flavor isn’t very good either. If you wanted this 2 part cap style RDA, your better off with the phobia 2 or just grab one of the other dozen or so options on my list that are much better. I won’t be adding this to my sheet of recs linked down below.


This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

t3_9r0r7t,"Foment [review] - well, lets get on with it... The Wellon Tech Lux!","What’s up today folks? Today I’ve got a little tiny pod system to discuss with you, the [Wellon Lux](https://www.wellontech.com/product/lux/). The pod system was sent to me by [Wellon Tech](https://www.wellontech.com/) for the purposes of this review. The little draw to fire device is yet another entry into the growing pod market, but how does it stack up to the competition? Let’s discuss!

#Photo Dump
----------------------------------

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/mobvHUp)

#Device Aesthetics
-------------------------------------

It’s a slick little pen, with LED lighting that comes through the cutaways in the metal shell spelling out a mildly stylized “LUX”. The pod cap is black on all models, as is the tip containing the USB port, but the shell is a very thin, and consequently very light painted metal.The pods themselves are perfectly clear which makes checking the juice level in the 2ml capacity pods very easy, and is nice to see. Refilling is similarly easy, requiring nothing more than removing the cap (though often the whole pod will come free of the device) The silicone grommet under the cap has 2 small holes in it to allow juice filling, which makes refills from anything with a needle tip a snap. Glass droppers would be more difficult, but removing the grommet would be trivial enough to make that a non-issue.The LED light will glow one of three colors in use. Green when relatively fully charged,blue once charge has diminished below a certain level, and white once it has gotten near the end of the battery life. Though my experience has not been that I see the white LED, but that after a time with the blue I will receive the red flashing error indication before the battery level reaches low enough to display white. That much is frustrating given the 450mah battery is *maybe* enough to get through a full day of intermittent use, so cutting it short is a disappointment.


#Device Performance
---------------------------------------

It’s a draw to fire system, and that much works pretty well. In a few instances I’ve had the pods fail to fire, and some of that appears to be due to juice weeping through the bottom air inlet.That much is actually somewhat curious as I’ve also found the coils are a bit slow to wick. Breaking the seal between the pod and the cap resolves that quickly enough, so I’m inclined to believe that it’s vacuum locking when the cap is fully inserted. Leaving the cap a bit looser does help some of the time, but it’s far from an actual solution. This is all experience with 50/50 and 60/40 juice. Nothing terribly thick. Conversely, when the device is working correctly, the flavor is actually pretty reasonable. It’s nothing life changing, but certainly good enough to pass muster relative to some other pods I’ve tried. The pod life is also a bit better than others owing perhaps to the ceramic elements that are used. There is also an issue where the device can, and in my experience, will occasionally continue to fire for a second or so after a draw. This I believe is related to the juice seeping out of the air inlet and onto the draw sensor. Despite using the device for multiple weeks, the issue is extremely intermittent. I’d venture that with regular use it would become more frequent as more juice or condensation collects in or around the sensor.

**Pros:**   
* Extremely light weight  
* LED indicates battery level better than many pods   
* Comfortable in use

**Cons:**    
* Coils take a long time to break in   
* Intermittent issues with the draw sensor are likely to become worse over time   
* Coils fail to wick efficiently enough for even 50/50 juice.

#Final Thoughts
-----------------------------------

Were this the very first device in Wellon’s lineup I’d say it’s a fair first effort, and even still now it has merits. There’s too much wrong here to recommend the pod system in its current state, but with larger wicking ports and a more robust draw sensor a version two could well be a winner. There is enough to like here that I could see some users able to overlook the flaws, but I don’t think it’s where it needs to be yet to offer a consistent and satisfying experience.

t3_9qxkui,Just got my new vape in and the tank seems a little off! (Fireluke mesh pro),"So I had heard amazing reviews about this tank and it's insane flavor and stuff and im a flavor junkie(I know rda's are the best, but im just getting back into sub ohm vaping and don't want to jump into the deep end just yet lol).  

Well, I am using the single coil kanthal that came in the box and honestly I am a little disappointed with the flavor.  I had the original revenger kit and the nrg tank I remember having such a deep saturated flavor as opposed to this just sorta flat, kinda there hot flavor(Vaping at 45W when the recommended lowest is 40W and it's still pretty damn warm) the coil is also reading at .13ohm when it's rated at .15ohm.  Could this be the mod or the coil?    

I am using the vapetasia killer custard, it's a vanilla custard.  Could this be due to the in the box coils and maybe once these go out and I need new ones the vape will be better?  Or could it be the juice?  I have used Taruto which is a custard flavor and in the nrg tank it was a very deep custard flavor where as in the mesh pro it's a very light flavor all around.",Wed Oct 24 00:26:46 PDT 2018,vaginalfisting
t3_9qzumm,HAVA One pod mod review,"What’s up ECR!
Today I’ve got some details on another pod system, this one is from HAVA called the “One”, let’s jump right in.

I want to start by saying this device is super cool looking and feeling, it’s all metal and weighs a lot for its stealthy size (in a good way) and to me it looks like some sort of alien tech, I love the build and styling of this thing. 

In the box you’ll get your One device, a single 1.2ohm ceramic coil, micro usb cable, rubber mouthpiece stopper, rubber mouthpiece cover (optional), and of course all the standard documents. 

In addition to the 1.2 ohm ceramic coils, cotton coils are available, there is no resistance printed on the cotton coil packaging so I’m just going to assume that they are also 1.2 ohms.
Each pod holds 2ml of e-liquid, filled via two holes on the top of the pod under a rubber gasket. 
The instruction manual says each pod can be refilled about 15 times before needing to be replaced, I’d say that’s fairly accurate for the ceramic coils, but I got fewer refills with the cotton pods. 

Moving back to the device, all of the necessary components are hidden behind a magnetic door on the front of the device, once removed you will find the pod location and the micro usb charge port. 
The front cover also has a small cutout in it to allow the multifunctional led to shine through, this light changes color and flash pattern to signify vaping modes and battery level. 

Use of this device is super simple, once you’ve filled and inserted your pod (and let sit for 15 minutes for new pods) you simply draw to activate. There are three modes to choose from with somewhat redundant names, but it’s basically “normal power”, “high power”, and “bypass”, which doesn’t need much elaboration, a triple click of the front panel will cycle through modes each indicated by a different color led. 

Performance of the HAVA One is actually pretty solid, I was really surprised by the amount of vapor production compared to other pod systems I’ve used, certainly more vapor than my Aspire Breeze 2. 

Flavor is good too, probably on par with the Breeze 2, the flavor comes through about as crisp and unmuted as any pod I’ve used, slightly better when using the cotton coils but still flavorful with the ceramic as well. 

All things considered I actually really dig this little guy, it’s stealthy, feels of quality with the all metal design, puts out some great vapor and flavor. I think the only thing I can outright knock it for is the somewhat small pods, I’ll go through more than one but less than two in a day, but obviously that’s just based on my personal usage, and either way 2mls is pretty average for pod systems so I can’t exactly complain. 

I think I covered most of the topic here but if you have any other questions about this device leave a comment below, thanks!

t3_9qzgmu,Smok al85 dark screen problem,"So I bought al85 about 3 months ago, it had been working almost flawlessly for the first 2 and a half. After that I had a problem which many users had which is getting ""battery low"" message at 50% and battery life jumping to a 100 whenever plugged in but at first it wasn't a big deal for me so I ignored it, but later the battery started dying out really fast so after reading some posts I decided to buy a new battery. After I took out the old one and put in a brand new one the mod didn't turn on at all. Whenever I plug it into a charger it seems okay at first, but then after a ""new coil"" message and pressing fire button i get ""battery low"" screen and it gets really dark and battery goes to 0%. Tried putting the old battery back but it's all the same. Plugging it into a computer doesn't fix it either. I tried finding solutions on other forums but couldn't find anything.

I have a few questions. I may want to start using a drip tip, but of course I need a tank for on the go.

Is it possible to have a tank and a drip tip on the same mod?  
And when using drip tips, do you always need to make your own coils or can they be bought prebuild?  

I am currently using a vapresso estoc tank with sub-ohm coils suitable for 25-35 watts. I guess that's not enough for a drip tip system but I don't know for sure.

I'm planning on buying the Innokin Kroma-A and Innokin Zenith kit/pack, and was hoping some people would be able to chime in on wether this would suit/work at all, and if anyone has experience with the particular device in case there's a tip or two to be given about specific PG/VG balances and such.

t3_9qwpcu,Did I pick the right coils?,"So I ordered from ohmlandcoils for the third time, this time I'll be trying out a pair of high gauge staples.

www.ohmlandcoils.com/products/staple-coil

This was after emailing them asking what they would recommend for using solely in a mech. I told them I want large surface area and low coil mass with multiple cores of high gauge wire, which is what I believe previous Reddit users suggested would be ideal for my situation (fast ramp up, big clouds, lots of flavor).

There were so many choices I felt overwhelmed so I just picked one that was low resistance but not too low for my batteries (settled on the 10x.13/44 Ni80 ones).

Anywho, I was wondering if this guy actually steered me in the right direction or should I have ordered something different? If the latter, can anyone recommend a website that makes high quality coils of various types, preferably in the US? I don't mind spending $15-$25 as long as they last me at least two months, which is the duration my ohm land coils usually run before looking worn out like a middle aged adult film actress.

t3_9quj8v,Shortness of Breath After Vaping From 1 Month (Non-Smoker),"I looked all over the internet for answers, & only few sources seemed to slightly satisfy them. So I am currently experiencing some trouble breathing after a month of me quitting vaping. If this helps at all, I am a 20 year-old male from Indiana. I would also like to point out that I never smoked before, & I only vaped for 4 months before I started having breathing difficulties. It feels as if only 90% of air is able to enter my lungs, I can also feel mucus at some points when I breathe deep enough. I SHOULD be able to cough this gunk out, but nothing ever comes out (dry cough). Over the time I vaped, I accumulated only 3 juices, blueberry pomegranate (High VG 3mg), Watermelon (60/40 PG/VG 6mg), & strawberry lemonade (30/70 PG/VG 6mg). For most of the time, I vaped off the blueberry pomegranate, & only tried watermelon a couple of times. Eventually, I acquired the strawberry lemonade & started vaping off it for a while. Keep in mind that I did not experience shortness of breath until about a month after vaping off the strawberry lemonade. My mod is a Smok Stick V8 Baby, just in case this helps.

The best research I was able to find is that in theory, the cilia in my lungs are damaged, therefore I need to let them heal. But All I know is that generally applies to smokers, not vapers.

     As far as I know, all I am experiencing is shortness of breath, occasional heavy breathing, & a dry cough that is always voluntary. What really worries me is that I am not coughing up anything after 1 month of feeling this. If anything, VERY few amounts of mucus with little to no change in my lungs. I am planning on scheduling a doctor's appointment to find out if my lungs are going to be fine. In all honestly, this is getting to the point where it is scaring me to vape anymore. I am worried that I inflicted some bad damage on my respiratory system, & I wanna know what in the world is going on with my lungs right now.

t3_9qtq32,Rebuildable MTL RTA in Europe? (Price does not matter),"Hello!

&#x200B;

I am an ""advanced"" vaper. I have used the Kayfun 3.1, 4 and 5 in the past.

The 4 and the 5 were so over-engineered that I got them frequently stuck and ended up using pliers on them and destroyed the 510 threads on both.

&#x200B;

After my frustration with the Kayfun 5, I went to the Ares RTA just to try something else.

I quite like the design and the philosophy but the throat hit is just not there. I end up using 50/50 liquids but it is still lacking compared to my Kayfun years.

t3_9qtpm9,Bought Aspire Breeze 2 coils on accident....,"So I was actually trying to order some new coils for my Aspire Spryte and when I finally got my order in the mail, I realized I ordered the Breeze 2 coils instead. I was pretty annoyed with myself, checked my order and realized I did indeed accidentally place that order due to my own negligence of not looking more closely. So because I already opened the package and its not the seller's fault, I figured either I order the correct coils for my Spryte, or buy a Breeze 2. The option to buy a Breeze 2 is looking more appealing because I always want to have a new mod and it would cost almost the same to order 2 packs of Spryte coils.

So basically I'm just here to ask... how are people liking their Breeze 2 and how does it compare to the Spryte? Is it a newer product? How do the coils compare? I've been pretty happy with the Spryte, not TOO much to complain about other than the fact the filling can be slightly annoying (not that big of a deal though) and the coils seem pretty solid but some coils are definitely better than others, although that can be said for most coils.

t3_9qto80,Clueless what vape to get to replace my Sigelei 150W TC,"Hey guys, I hate having to put posts like this up because there's so many recommendations and such on the web, but I'm wondering if any of you can suggest something fitting as a replacement?

I've had this Sigelei a good while and it's served me well, it has a Uwell Crown tank (1st gen) which works fine, but the Sigelei is getting a bit old and tatty, also one of the magnets is missing, and I figured id rather replace it than have it die on me!

I was considering the Sigelei Cobra (or Sobra as I've seen it called) and I've looked up various vapes online and It's a little overwhelming!

Appreciate your time! thanks :)  


EDIT: BIG thank you to everyone who took the time to share info! I'm pretty clueless on vaping now since everything has changed so much!",Tue Oct 23 15:08:17 PDT 2018,AlxEllis
t3_9qthbf,Suggest me FastTech cheap RDAs & RDTAs with huge well. And other must-haves.,"Yep, the title. Allow me to explain a bit.

I live in Greece. And the government here decided to ban ANY and ALL imports of vapestuffen. That means I can't buy stuff from abroad anymore. No more China-shops for me. And no cheap clones.

Enter a friend in Germany.

He was uber-kind to accept to receive stuff for me and bring it over whenever he visits. BUT, he can't be receiving small packages day-in, day-out, nor each and every month. So, we've decided that one or two times each year I'll batch-order some stuff. Now's one of those times.

I've already ordered...

* Smoant Cylon
* Dovpo M VV
* Kindbright Redemption Styled RDA
* Dead Rabbit Styled RDA
* GOON V1.5 Styled RDA
* GOON Ti Styled RDA *(and I've already groked I borked with this one, since the posts are painted blue, but oh, well, you live and learn...)*
* Fuel V2 Styled RDA Rebuildable Dripping Atomizer 
* MAGE Combo Styled RDTA 
* Apocalypse GEN 2 Styled RDTA (x2 different variants)

...and am looking for other must-haves or generally ""stuff that most people thought was better than average"" during 2017-2018. Since I don't have a single postless whatever yet (no RDA, RDTA, RTA, nothing), I'd like one of those, mostly to experiment with huge single coils and kilos of cotton. The Pyro RDTA clone @FT looked good, but there's also a supposedly better Pyro V2 out. But even the clone costs three times as much as other stuff @FT (yeah, I'm a cheapskate). Anything similar you'd suggest? Or any RDAs that aren't a pain to build and have relatively huge wells? I do love my Derringers, but I don't like having to redrip every second hit.

One thing to keep in mind, and the reason I've explained my situation, is that I'm trying to keep crap and flukes to a minimum. See, vaping stuff doesn't usually have warranties, but I'm in an even worse position than the average buyer since I'll receive and be able to test everything MONTHS after actually buying it. So, if for example the Cylon ends up being dead, I'm stuck with it. Same thing with atomizers, and the reason I've picked Redemption/Apocalypse-style RDAs/RDTAs, since I've already used one, liked it and think not much can go wrong with this design.

So... any suggestions? Is there anything that you thought was really-really worth it and I should try out?

I'll end this noting that I've got up to 50 bucks to spend. I'd prefer, say, getting 5 good RDA clones instead of ""only"" one really good RTA. Paying more for a single item *would* probably lead to a better experience, and I like authentics as much as the next guy, but in my position, I also need *backups* if something fails. I can buy ""a single good authentic"" at Greek shops for +half to +double the cost people outside Greece would pay, but I can't buy clones of cheap stuff, so that's the priority nowadays when ordering from abroad. This and mods - that with a +half to +double cost here, you end up paying for a Wismec like you would for a Dicodes :-P

Thanks in advance for any answers and suggestions.",Tue Oct 23 14:45:50 PDT 2018,ducklord
t3_9qtdbt,Can we please ban questions regarding salt nicotine?,"Edit: in this post I state that freebase nicotine is more potent than salts. Here are some links which support this:

https://www.ruthlessvapor.com/blogs/ruthless-e-liquid/nicotine-salt-vs-freebase-why-nicotine-salt-is-the-new-craze

https://amp-reddit-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Deeper_DIY/comments/3k6h2r/nicotine_freebase_vs_salt_absorption_vaporization/?usqp=mq331AQECAEoAQ%3D%3D&amp_js_v=0.1

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4w8o3g/eli5what_is_a_freebase_drug/

Freebase is better for vaporization. 

Every day I see at least 5 posts all asking the exact same questions about salt nic (what brands sell nic salts, where do I buy nic salts juice, what mg should I use, can I subohm nic salts, and my personal favorite ""can you use nic salts in ______ pod system?""..... ?????). Salt nic is literally exactly the same as regular nicotine only salt nic has less throat hit and is less potent than freebase nicotine in vapor. Is there any way we can add a sticky or something that tells people this, and maybe lists some brands and vendors? I am also making this request on diy ejuice. It is incredibly annoying and it has been clogging my feed daily with identically ignorant and nonsense posts for almost a year now (and yes I know my account isn't that old, I started deleting and changing accounts regularly early this year because I don't like being addicted to internet points).



It would also be great if we could put an end to the myth that salt nicotine is more potent in vaporizers than freebase is. Anyone who anything about biochemistry knows that in general freebasing (aka vaporizing) a salt is far less effective than freebasing/vaping a freebase. Salts for any drug (including nicotine) are as a general rule meant for pills or sublinguals. This is why cocaine hcl (normal coke) is far less potent than crack cocaine (the freebase of coke) when vaporized.


I'm sorry if this post seems inflammatory; I understand that it's good for people to get answers to their questions, I just think that about 99% of nic salt questions have been asked already and that at this point it needs to be addressed in a wiki or sticky.",Tue Oct 23 14:32:54 PDT 2018,tawy7432
t3_9qt75x,Pod Devices need to step up and git good.,"There's been a ton of posts lately about pod devices. People needing help or deciding on a new one. The pod arena is pretty much where we were 4 years ago. Manufacturers need to step up, and start releasing good devices. 

The vape industry grew from the early days of mechs and sub 30 watt mods, to the DNA30, to subohm tanks (Kanger and Aspire Atlantis), to temp control, to 25mm atomizers, and now mesh coils. 

I feel like when the tipping point of finding a hit or miss device was when the transition to 25mm started. Around that time, most atomizers, and even mods, went to pretty much any recommended product would be good. There might be some things that didn't fit you right, but most things shifted over to being ""good"". 

The pod industry feels like it's in between the DNA30 and subohm era. There's a few good devices out there, but by and large it's hot garbage. Spitting, leaking, burning coils, poor fitment, etc.

I know it's a cash grab, and might as well iterate because everyone is always just looking for the new thing. But, shock the rest of the industry and come out with something great, something mesh coil or temp control industry changing already. 

I know there's the Innokin EQ, and Orion which are among the closest to being great devices, and I'm sure a couple others that are highly regarded. But, even these are getting complaints about them.

t3_9qt1qm,My future boss is asking me to help her open a vape shop!,"So, one of my mom friends from town is opening up a cbd based apothecary shop. She's going to have bath and body stuff, as well as her own brand of cbd products. She's also doing dry herb too. Shes opening her shop with my help next weekend and I'm excited for it! I've been stuck in a rut ever since I had my baby and this is a new project! 

Today, we were going over plans for her apothecary shop, and she mentioned she also has another building available to her, and she wants to open a vape shop in the extra building! She knows nothing about the vaping community. We have no vape shops in our town, so she wants to 'pioneer' all these new shops to bring a new market to our little town

So she's asking me to do some research, help her make a juice line, and run the shop for her!! I'm so excited but I don't know where to start! It's been about three years since I've worked in a vape shop, and I know how fast things change in this industry! 

So I guess what I'm looking for is help? Whats popular flavor wise these days? I know I could just go visit other shops and see what they have, but she's wanting me to help her create a juice line unique to her shop. What hardware is popular? She's not wanting to go into the heavy hardware like mods and rdas or anything like that, what's some good starter kits to put in the shop? What are the most popular coils out there she should keep stocked?? 

Sorry for all these questions, I'm just lost as to new technology and what people like these days. If it were left up to me I'd just make a line of juices I know I'd like (just because I don't really remember what was popular at my old shop). Thank you for your help in advance!!

Flavour is all I care about, and I would like to know if the Lotus would be an upgrade flavour wise. I don't have an issue with spending some money as long as I'm actually going to get better flavour, but I don't want to just get a new tank for the sake of having it. Shinyitis is real!

3 month convert from the cylinders of doom looking for some help.

As far as I can see I can only get coils in 1.5 ohms or 0.8 ohms to fit the tank. I am using the 0.8 ohm coils, but I'd like to try a lower resistance if possible. Are there any other coils that would be compatible with my tank and battery?

t3_9qqqke,Anthony Vapes: Wotofo Profile RDA Review,"Hi All, Anthony Vapes back here with my review of the Wotofo Profile RDA, please see the bottom for disclaimers and links. Note: This is not marked as a sample version 


##Introduction:
 
 
The Wotofo Profile RDA is the latest RDA from popular vape manufacturer Wotofo (well latest available but a new Faris RDA just showed up for review as i’m writing this). Wotofo has been hit and miss for me, they’ve made some good RDAs like the recurve and nudge 22, but also a lot of overhyped and bad ones like the warrior RDA, troll RTA, and some others, so they are a bit hit and miss IMO. it’s designed in collaboration with Mr Just Right 1 which i have no clue who he is personally. The Profile RDA is a mesh coil 24mm DTL RDA with an included squonk pin that can also be used as a single coil RDA. It’s available in 6 colors, Black, SS, Gold, Gunmetal, Blue, and Rainbow.  I looked around online and see it in the 25 USD price range out of china and 30ish price range in the US so good price point.

##Initial Impressions
 
When I first got this RDA I was pretty impressed with the design. They include cotton and mesh coils made for the RDA and sent me some extras of both, but the one thing that stood out was the spring loaded ceramic block that keeps the cotton pushed up against the mesh. That was a really good idea we haven’t seen in a mesh RDA so far so well done there. The included cotton also fits well as does the precut mesh strips although technically it’s not mesh but more of a honeycomb coil as i call them but for the sake of the review i’ll just call it mesh as many companies use that design coil and call it mesh. Overall though pretty impressed form the start. 


 
##Build Deck and Wicking (pics above)
 
Let’s talk about the build deck now. It’s a 2 clamp system with the clamps positioned for vertical insertion instead of horizontal like many. Very similar to the VV mesh RDA deck design except the clamps are raised off the deck. The screws come in from the side so it does work well for flat wire, mesh, and round wire builds but you do need to precut your leads. The Mesh that comes with it is cut to size however and doesn't need any modifications. The post screws are good quality flat head/phillips combo screws so nice improvement there as wotofo has normally used some cheap poor quality screws in lots of RDAs. There is also a cut out on the juice well wall that acts as a place for the top cap to lock in but doubles to add room to get your screwdriver in there to use the post screws. Overall a really nicely designed deck that works with any wire type and is easy to build on. Just note that you will need to precut leads for using anything but the included mesh strips that are precut.

 
Wicking on it is quite easy. It’s an RDA so nothing fancy just drop your leads to the bottom for traditional coil builds. For Mesh builds this is where it gets cool, there is a spring loaded ceramic block between the posts and this allows the cotton to be pressed against the mesh coil easier so you don’t get dry hits. Very good idea indeed. Also the included cotton they make for it fits just right (no pun intended) so you just need to cut the ends and fluff them up making wicking very easy. When using a traditional coil the ceramic block isn’t used. Overall very easy to wick for mesh or traditional coils. 


##Performance

Performance wise, I used it as a Single Coil RDA and a Mesh RDA. I ran 4 builds in this a fancy 3mm ID build, a fancy 4 mm ID build, 1 mesh build with the included mesh and 1 simple round 4mm ID build. For size I found it worked best with the 4mm ID and the fancy builds or using the mesh. For the mesh coil I will say it’s the best flavor i’ve gotten from mesh in any RDA overall so it’s the best option for a mesh RDA. As a single coil RDA it’s just ok with a large fancy build and not worth much with the round builds and pretty space limited. Overall I’d say it’s great for a mesh RDA, but just decent not using mesh and overall not as good as a good single coil RDA but still the best RDA for mesh.

 
##Overall Impressions, Details, and Extras
 
Let’s talk about the airflow now. It’s a standard side airflow RDA with 19 small holes on each side. It’s 3 rows with 6 on the top and bottom rows and 7 on the middle row. It’s a pretty airy DTL single coil RDA. It starts closing off the top row 1st then after that is closed off, closes off the bottom 2 rows at the same time all being closed off right to left. It works well enough but there isn’t much to grip on the top cap making it more difficult than it needs to be, they should have added some knurling. Also the annoying part about the air is, it’s really hard to see what’s closed off and what isn’t so it’s hard to see where your air is at.It is adjustable from a very airy DTL vape to a restrictive DTL vape so well done there. The top cap o-rings are good and it’s easy to pop off and on. 


 It comes with 1 standard 810 friction fit clear (likely PMMA) drip tip and 1 standard 810 friction fit resin drip tip. I’m glad they included 2 options. Other 810 tips I used both friction fit and o-ring ones fit good as well.  The resin drip tip you get depends on the color option. The SS comes with a blue one and looks nice. They is no 510 adapter though so can't use a 510 on it unless you already have an adapter. The Drip tip fits very well in the RDA. snug, not loose, not tight. The quality on the Wotofo Profile is overall good. The o-rings for the top cap onto the base feel right and the top cap is snug but not tight. Very easy to take apart with no issues. The AFC is somewhat easy to adjust but could have benefitted from some knurling and is hard to see, the o-rings fit just right and everything is nicely done. The post screws are good quality as well (which has been an issue with them in the past) and 2 spare screws are included (both flat head/phillips combo screws). It comes with a standard 510 pin and a BF 510 pin like most RDAs these days as well.

The juice well is a good size. Considering the height of the air holes with the top cap on i consider it to be pretty large. With the mesh your cotton will take all of it up, but with a regular coil there is spare room as less cotton is needed. The over squonk protection and Over drip protection is pretty good. The side airflow is high enough up that it doesn't cause any issues leaking when dripping or squonking. I only used it as a dripper as i’m not currently working on a review for any squonk mods but i did put it on a squonk mod just to test it real quick and it worked well. As a dripper you can drip right down the drip tip without taking off the top cap. 

It’s a 24mm diameter so should not overhang on most mods on the market today. The deck is for a 22mm RDA though and the top cap is just extra thick which is nice much like the recurve RDA they made prior to this. Accessory wise, There is plenty of spare o-rings and 2 spare post screws,1 allen wrench, 1 coil wrapping tool, no 510 tip adapter, 1 standard coil and 2 mesh coils, 1 piece of cotton, 2 spare springs, and the 2 drip tips. Good amount of accessories overall. The only thing I feel missing would be some more cotton and a 510 adapter but not a big deal. The coils do come labeled which is great. All manufacturers should do this. The standard coil is a Ni80 framed staple clapton according to the label made of ni80 28+38x9+28+36 3mm ID 5 wraps .33 ohms. The mesh coils are KA1 16x6.8mm .18 ohm good for 45-65 watts ( I liked it at 55-60 watts personally so good rating. Branding is very simple and nice. Just the Profile logo engraved in matching color (on the SS version at least)  on one side between the air holes Very nice there and it’s engraved in a matching color according to pics on the gold, SS, black, and rainbow so doesn't stand out too much except on the gunmetal and blue where the logo is white.


##Pros: 
 
* 2 Standard 810 drip tips (resin and clear)
* standard 510 pin and squonk pin included
* plenty of spare o-rings
* 6 Color Options 
* good quality phillips/flat head combo screws with spares
* Good over squonk protection
* works well as a dripper or squonker
* good flavor for a mesh RDA
* good flavor with a large fancy build
* good size juice well
* good build quality
* nice looks, not overly branded
* build deck is excellent and easy to build on
* Price point (under 30 USD)
* included coils are clearly labeled and cotton is included
* spring loaded ceramic plate makes wicking mesh easy




 
##Cons:
 

* really bets used for mesh (better options for a single coil RDA out there)
* AFC is hard to see and needed some grip on it
* no 510 tip adapter
* should have included 1 more piece of cotton
* blue and gunmetal logos stand out too much

 
##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this RDA?I don’t like to do a hard yes or no, but this one leans towards the yes. If you are looking for a mesh RDA this is the best one i’ve used so far overall as far as flavor, ease of build and ease of wicking so this is the one to get which is why it leans towards the yes. It’s also good enough as a single coil RDA but if you aren’t planning to use mesh there are better options out there and better to but an RDA not made for mesh. I’ll be adding this to my list of recs linked down below since it’s the best mesh RDA but still isn’t as good as just using better single coil RDAs with nice fancy builds overall. 


This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

t3_9qqokc,What was I doing wrong?,"I have just moved to Sqounking after using regulated MTL devices for a while. I was building coils myself using a flapton wire. The first wire that I used for building was a very rigid wire which was a challenge to wrap into a coil. I tested every build I made to ensure that I was getting the right resistance etc. I had massive clouds but very underwhelming flavour and was using a massive amount of juice. Coils were getting very dirty and burning out in a couple days too. 

I got some new wire, which is a lot softer and a lot more malleable, a lot like solder wire in its malleability. It’s still flapton but a different wire to my original one. 

The difference is like night and day, the new wire that I’m using is producing a lot stronger flavour and much more satisfying hit. My builds are pretty much the same resistance to my old ones. 

I was wondering what I was doing wrong originally? 

Also can you reuse coils with new cotton? 

Thanks in advance :)",Tue Oct 23 09:36:51 PDT 2018,KnyfeGaming
t3_9qqjov,Did my local vape shop sell me fake VTC5s?,"I needed a set a batteries in a pinch so I picked up a pair of VTC5s from a local shop for $10 a piece. They looked legit at first, but their performance doesn't seem to match the VTC5s I got from IMRbatteries. Unfortunately I can't compare because I've since recycled my old ones. They don't last near has long as my LG HE4s which have been used heavily for a year. When they get to around 40% my mod cuts out, my old VTC5s could get down to about 15% before it would cut out. I threw them on my hohm base charger in mAh test mode and got readings around 1800mAh. I don't trust the accuracy 100%, but old, lower rated and heavily used batteries tested above 2000mAh. I've attached pictures of the batts. I found a guide online and most of it checks out, the QR code looking thing looks like the fake one, but everything else looks real as far as I can tell. The guide was from 2015 so I'm sure the fakes and possibly the real ones have changed a bit since then.

t3_9qqg5z,(Another) Havahali Goliath Beetles Review,"This is a short-term review on the **HAVA Goliath Beetles Kit**

*There are more in depth and technical reviews on vaping products, my reviews are not designed to be like that. I focus more on customer experience. Did the product provide me with enjoyment? Is it good value for money? It is easy to use? Does it feel durable? Does my girlfriend like it enough to take up vaping?*

**Disclaimer**
This device was sent to me by [**Havahali**](https://havahali.com/) for review. 

**Images**

[**These images**](https://imgur.com/a/qYtVgKb) were taken by me.


**Product Overview**
A dual 18650 220w “HAVA Goliath Beetles” mod with the HAVA “VTank” that takes both 0.5ohm Kanthal Parallel coil-heads and 0.15ohm Kanthal Mesh coil-heads. (Also, I have been informed that it takes Freemax Fireluke Mesh coil-heads – I will test these and update this review, when I manage to locate them)

**Price**

* $99.99 from the Havahali Website

* $62.99 from 3fVape

* I haven’t seen the tank or mod available on their own – right now it seems like buying the kit is the only available option.

**In the box**	

* Goliath Beetles Mod

* VTank (fitted with 5ml bubble tank and 0.15 Mesh Coil Head

* 1 x 0.5 standard coil-head

* 1 x 3ml straight tank

* 1 x USB cable

* O-rings

* Manual, warranty, warning card, etc.

**First impressions**

The Goliath Beetles Kit is packaged very well. A good quality box that came in perfect condition, with foam inserts and (subjective) nicely designed graphics. The packaging looks like something I would get with a Japanese electronic product, with no attempt to appeal to any specific age/social group. The mod looks good  **but** it’s a fingerprint magnet. This isn’t an issue for me – I work at home and have a micro-fiber cloth to keep it shiny, but it might put some people off – this does of course mean that once you polish it, it looks awesome.

**Ease of use**	

Everything comes apart and goes back together very easily. Although I read the instructions, there was no need – it’s all common sense for anyone who vapes. **However**, for a first time vaper there could have been slightly more detailed instructions and more attention paid to priming the coil-heads.
Replacing the coil-heads and glass is easy and well explained in the user manual.

**Chipset Functions**	

* Power modes include: Normal, Power, Bypass and Curve.	

* There is also a Temp Control mode – which I haven’t tested as temp control isn’t my thing.

* Some of the functions listed on the manual are either hard to find on the menu or missing. 

**Build Quality**	

* The mod and tank feel solid, with the tank being made of zinc alloy.

* There are no button rattles.

* There is a little movement from the battery door when open - when closed there is no movement.

* The threading on the VTank top cap could be a little smoother, the first quarter turn doesn’t feel perfect.

* (subjective) While the 810 drip-tip seems to be a perfect diameter for the tank, it feels a little thin and cheap.

* So far, I’ve had zero leaks. 

**Flavor**

* With the standard coil, the flavor is fine – this surprised me as I was only looking forward to the mesh coil, but with the right juice it’s good.


* However, as expected the tank comes alive with the mesh coil. Both clouds and flavor are improved with the mesh coil.

* While closing the airflow a little does increase the flavor, it also increases the chance of a dry hit. I’d rather leave it wide open.

* The HAVA representative confirmed to me that their tank is compatible with Freemax Fireluke Mesh coil-heads, I will confirm this and update my review once I get and try these coil-heads in the VTank.


**Ergonomics**

* The mod works well in both left and right hands, however if you’re a lefty and you prefer to fire with your thumb, your hand will obscure the display. 

* The battery door is easy to open/close and the batteries slide in easily, so far there are zero scratches on my wraps.

* The airflow control has good tolerances and has stoppers on fully open/closed.

* Nice fire button action.

* The up/down buttons don’t require enough pressure, so it’s easy to accidentally change settings.

**Girlfriend opinion** (I want to give my girlfriend’s opinion on all vaping products, as she is a smoker that I’m trying to tempt into switching to vaping)
3/10 – She said that the box looked classy and the kit was pretty. However, when I said she could have it to start vaping, she didn’t want it. Although I want her to start vaping, I also want to keep this for myself, so a low girlfriend score can be considered a win for me.

**What could be improved?**

* Better drip-tip or multiple drip-trips.

* Forget the standard coil-head – market it as a mesh tank and include only mesh coil-heads.

* Stiffen the up/down buttons to the same level as the fire button.

**Pros**

* Good build quality.	

* Easy out of the box flavor.

* (subjective) Good looks. While I wouldn’t have chosen the color they sent me – it does look quite fancy.

* Clear screen and easy menu.

* It works with Freemax Fireluke Mesh coil-heads.

**Cons**

* Only currently available as a kit.

* Fingerprint magnet.

* Official price is high.

**Conclusion**	

**Who should buy this?**

* Someone who wants a well built and good-looking kit that performs well straight out of the box.

* Someone who wants to start vaping but wants to leave their options open by having a decent mod that will work well with rebuildables in the future.

**Who should not buy this?**

* Someone who gets most of their satisfaction from tinkering with coils/wicks.

* Someone who cares about the amount of juice they use. (I’ve gone through about 20ml in the past three hours!)

**Would I buy this?**

* Absolutely and yes – depending on when.

* I  wish this had been on the market when I first started vaping. It would have been the perfect purchase for me and would have offered a great upgrade path.

* Right now. Yes, I would still buy it – it’s an easy and stress-free way to vape.

t3_9qq0md,"Looking for a pod system with a bit more airflow. Seeking direct experience, please.","I’ve tried multiple pod systems and they’re all a little tight on the airflow for me. I know MTL is supposed to be tight but I’m looking for something like a restricted DL. I’ve tried Suorin Drop, Aspire Breeze 1 & 2, Smok Rolo Badge, Suorin Air and maybe a few more that escape me. I tried a Juul once and that was pretty close. I’ve heard great things about the Kandypens Rubi but it’s $50. I’ve also had my eye on the Lost Vape Orion but that’s even more expensive. I’ve also been looking at the Vandy Vape Simple EX. I like the rebuildable aspect but I’m worried about airflow. I’m willing to spend the spend the money if I know I’ll like it. I enjoy all types of vaping, squonking, dual coil RTAs, series RDAs, even a sub-ohm tank from time to time. Finding the perfect pod or small AIO is currently my mission. Open pod system is a must, 800+mah preferred. Has anyone here tried the Orion, Simple Ex, or Rubi? Any other suggestions?

t3_9qpp7c,Nic salts tobacco flavor help,"Hey I'm hoping to get some advice here
I recently transitioned from smoking over a pack a day to using a Juul. In the interest of making less waste and saving myself a little money I've taken to refilling my pods a few times each before throwing them out. 

Even before I was a smoker I liked the smell of cigarettes (I know, most people think that's gross) 

I'm having trouble finding nic salt juice that actually tastes like cigarette smoke

The Juul ""classic tobacco"" is the closest I've found thus far. 
I noticed a lot of people like Virginia Tobacco, and so far all of the tobacco flavors I've bought to refill my pods has had a taste similar to VT. I really can't get into it. This might sound crazy, but it hit me on my third VT pod...it tastes like a can of peas to me. It's all I can taste now. I really don't want to spend any more money to vape pea juice.

I've tried baton ""southern leaf"" and again, tastes like peas. I had to throw it away. 

Anyone else out there prefer a flavor similar to Classic Tobacco? Can someone help me find a juice that actually tastes like cigarette smoke? At least more CT than VT?

Thanks!  ",Tue Oct 23 07:53:12 PDT 2018,BoozLee
t3_9qpjsc,Squonking problems with the Profile RDA,"**UPDATE - PROBLEM SOLVED**

**The problem is with the Desire Rage squonk bottle not the profile RDA. The bottle is too large. When the bottle is fully inserted the 510 squonk pin get blocked.**

**If you pull the bottle down out of the mod 1 or 2 mm. Its Squonks perfectly!!**

**The V2 bottle supposedly fixes this problem**


----------------------------

I am having problems Squonking using a Desire RAGE & Profile RDA. My first squonking set up.

I can squeeze and hold the bottle or pump it and i dont get the flood of juice soaking the cotton you see on youtube videos. 

I mix my own juice and prefer 70vg/30pg. Is this to thick to squonk? 

What ratio of juice are you squonking? People who diy do you thin your juice? 

Or should i try a different squonking dripper on my desire and use the profile as a dripper only?

Thanks!

t3_9qpgle,The Smoant Naboo: An Anxious Review,"Hiya everyone!! /u/AnxietyAttack2013 here again. Got another review for y’all. Today we’ll be taking a look at the Naboo kit from smoant. Now I can already hear what you’re saying. “BUT ANX!! This isn’t MTL!!” And you’d be right. The mod does come with a subohm tank. But I’ll be looking at this as if it were 2014 and I was still a cloud chaser. So enough of my rambling. Let’s take a look at this. 

Note: this will be a long review. 

Disclaimer: this kit was sent to me for the purpose of this review by Smoant. I will not let that, nor my feelings for the company, influence my thoughts and opinions or my review in any way. 

**BUT ANX THIS ISNT MTL!!! Like that? Cool, glad I got my line right! Anyway, what’s in the...is this in a tin too??**

Haha no no, not this time. We’re back to boxes. And in this box you’ll find:

The Naboo subohm tank

The Naboo mod

The Naboo subohm tank user manual

The Naboo mod user manual

A battery warning card

A warranty card

A quality certificate 

An extra 0.17 ohm mesh coil

A USB cord

And this kit retails for $68 from my trusted site. 

I’ve had to search a bit online for the coils but I’m finding them for $10 a 3 pack.

**take out the mod and show us!! What’s it like?**

[Smoant Naboo photo album. ](https://imgur.com/a/c90S1Ms)

This is a dual battery device with some nifty features. Full color screen, touch sensor buttons, lock button, music mode, etc. it’s definitely neat. Plus the tank uses mesh coils which are currently quite popular. Overall this kit seems to be quite inclusive. 

The mod itself is thick. E X T R A T H I C C. This isn’t a small device. its heavy and dense. But it’s not excessively big either. It fits very nicely in the pocket without too much of a bulge. That said you might need to dedicate a pocket for it as you won’t fit much else in there. 

The tank looks fairly average and is your typical 810 tip which means you’ll have a lot of options. It uses mesh coils and includes a .17 and a .18 ohm coil. It’s a top filling tank where you unscrew the top cap and fill it up. It also uses the bubble glass which does cut down on size while allowing a large capacity. Now since people are divisive on bubble glass, it does also include your typical tube glass too. 

The packaging is pretty basic. Cardboard box and foam inserts. Nothing pretty but honestly, you don’t need super fancy packaging. That said, everything is organized very nicely which I think is a plus. 

**that seems full of features. How was using it though?**

Okay so this is going to be a long one with all of the features and such going on. I’ll try and organize this as much as I can though. 

**that seems reasonable. How about we start with the screen and menu?**

That seems like a great place to start! To start out, this device utilized the “wattometer” that has become more and more prevalent. Honestly I’m not a huge fan of them. I think they look kinda tacky. That said, you can change it to a different display so you are not stuck with it if you don’t like it. But the screen itself is very bright. Thankfully you can change that too. But out of the box you have a bright “wattometer” styled display. 

This also vibrates with every button press. A fairly annoying feature in my opinion but again, but you can turn it off in the menu. 

**but how do I change these things Anx?** 

This mod uses a 3 click set up to access the menu. It does fire every press too. But once you get into the menu, you are faced with 4 submenus. VW Mode, TC Mode, Setting, and Wallpaper. You use the wattage up and down touch sensors/buttons to navigate through this. 

In the VW menu, you have min, norm, max, and VW curve as options. I have min, norm, and max, and I haven’t noticed any real difference in how they vape. I’m not 100% certain what they change as (when considering all other factors are consistent, a watt is a watt, right? I have not messed with the wattage curve but I’m honestly not super super technical. This submenu really hasnt been useful for me but I’m sure someone will find it more useful.

In the TC submenu, you have Nickel, Titanium, Stainless steel, TCR, and TC Curve. I’m not a temp control vaper so I don’t have much info on how well TC works but to me it seems like it does on any other device. But please note I always find TC mode to be very lackluster on every device I have used it on so don’t take my word on this part. 

The next submenu you have is Setting. In here you will find Brightness, Time, Display, screensaver, timeout, factory reset, and vibrate mode. Brightness is a simple adjustment that really needs no explanation. Up will make it brighter and down will make it less bright. Selecting time will allow you to set the time. The display will let you choose between dial mode (wattometer), classic mode, and music mode. Classic mode is what I keep this in usually. Screen saver allows you to choose either a watch face or a wallpaper as your screen saver. The time out setting allows you to choose how many seconds the display will be active for. Factory reset does exactly that. And finally, vibrate mode allows you to turn on and off the vibrate function. 

The last submenu we have is wallpaper. This will allow you to choose your wallpaper and in here you have 9 to choose from. 

**holy cannoli Batman!! That’s a lot of info. How did the menus work out for you?**

The VW menu was fairly useless for me. The different Min, Norm, Max modes didn’t change things for me. I keep it on norm usually because I didn’t see any difference between it and min or max. For me, this has always vaped very well and I haven’t felt much of a need to change anything. The TC menu also hasn’t seen much use by me as I’m not TC kinda guy. 

Now the setting menu has seen a fair amount of use. Adjusting the brightness was really easy in my experience. Adjusting the time however was a bit of a challenge. A few times the time was off by an hour even when I set it. I’ve had this happen twice, but it hasn’t happened to me in a while now and has been quite accurate since then. Otherwise the menu has worked very well and is easy to navigate. 

Upon further investigation, this happens with the clock every time I take the batteries out which is quite an annoying thing but an understandable one. It does remember the time it was when I took the batteries out, but it doesn’t auto adjust. But again, understandable seeing as there is nothing powering the device when the batteries are taken out. Still, it is annoying to have to set the clock every time you take the batteries out. 

For wallpapers, you have 9 options. And honestly most of them are pretty middle school edgy kinda. Something you’d see on deviant art back in 2010. But a couple are pretty cool and I actually really like the one I’ve chosen. I do wish you could have the watch as a wallpaper option though as I love the look of it. But as it stands, it works well. 

From reading the manual, I didn’t see a way to upload pictures but I have seen people do that I believe. So having that explained in the manual would be nice. 

**what about the music mode? How was that to use**

Eh...it functions. I tried it with a few different bands and overall it does better with increases of volume than the actual changes in the music. I threw on some stuff I had. Mainly American Football, John Coltrane, and Fall Of Efrafa. Some different genres to try and put it in its paces. The main thing I noticed was it would react to the changes in volume more than the notes themselves, but this may be due to the volume not being loud enough. 

Playing my own guitar did get a better reaction though. It wouldn’t follow the tempo really but it would change a bit more with the notes and chords I was playing as well as with volume. 

**wow. I’ve never seen a mod with so many menus and modes haha. How has using it every day been?**

The device itself has been fairly comfortable to hold. While large, it fills out the hand nicely. It is a little on the heavier side but not unbearably so. It feels natural to fire in either hand with either the thumb or index finger. Even in my smaller hands it doesn’t feel as large as it is. 

This device features touch sensors for the wattage up and down and these have worked very well. However it’s easy to accidentally adjust the wattage on this with casual use since there isn’t anything to actually press. I have had this jump in wattage in my pocket and just by using it. 

With that said, you can lock the wattage in a number of different ways. The first way is to touch both the up and down sensor at the same time for a second or two. Trying to adjust after doing this will bring up a notice that says “POWER.LOCKED HOLD.UP.DOWN”. This message also appears when locking the wattage. Nothing pops up when unlocking the wattage.

This works fairly well but has one issue. It’s easy to accidentally lock or unlock. There have been times where I unlock the wattage without realizing it and later find my wattage has jumped up or fallen. 

However, there is another way to lock the wattage. Underneath the fire button is an actual lock button. Pressing this once will lock the wattage and unlock the wattage. Using this I haven’t had the wattage unexpectedly unlock or adjust. 

Holding the lock button down will lock the entire device so it will not fire or adjust or anything. This is very similar to simply turning the device on or off but saves you time by not having to wait through the welcome screen. It also takes less time to lock the device than it does clicking the fire button five times. 

Speaking of welcome screens, the screen on this is def pretty rad. It’s very reminiscent of phone screens from the early 2010s. And not in a bad way. Compared to a lot of other screens and displays on mods, this is definitely one of the better ones I feel. Very bright and colorful and crisp all things considered. The wallpapers aren’t great in my opinion but the watch screensaver is very nice and I do wish it was a wallpaper option. 

**wow...that’s a lot to read....I hope there will be a TLDR at the end. How has it performed though?** 

This thing has been really enjoyable to use. In wattage mode it has performed as well as most of my mods do. However there is a very noticeable drop in power when the batteries get to around 1 bar. It drops significantly. At 75 watts it feels like 45 or 50. But at lower wattages such as 25 and under this isn’t an issue and not noticeable. 

The battery life on this does suffer a bit though. While most dual 18650 devices give me about 3 days of use on a single charge at 23.5 watts, this one has given me about 2 days consistently. And I feel like this is due to the screen just drinking so much power. 

Otherwise this has been solid. I’ve found no bugs or glitches or anything with this. The only thing I’ve noticed is the occasional misfire but that’s only happened twice and I feel like that was due to the fire button being a little firm to press. 

On that note, the fire button is a fairly firm press. It takes more force than you expect. Not super forceful but more than average. 

**wow, that’s so much info!!! I hate to ask but what about the tank?**

So this tank is a mesh coil subohm tank with your typical 810 drip tip that is compatible with most other subohm tanks. The airflow is quite generous but necessary I feel. This includes both a bubble glass which comes installed and a standard tube glass. The tip itself is a nice resin which matches nicely with the iridescent finish on this device. 

The coils have large wicking holes which is quite nice considering the wattage range of these coils. More than large enough to wick even at higher wattages. 

There doesn’t seem to be much room though between the chimney and the coil itself. This can make replacing the coil with juice in the tank difficult. 

**how did it perform though?** 

The flavor on this has been very good. Better than most subohm tanks I’ve used. This is likely due to the mesh coils. Now grant I have limited experience with mesh, but I am impressed with it. You do get a lot of the subtleties of the juice with this. Even with the airflow fully open I felt the flavor was more than good and with it closed down to about half way I felt the flavor was very good. I’ve heard that the flavor of mesh coils can be on par with some RDAs but never really believed it until now. While this isn’t as good as my preferred RDAs I can say it is as good as some older DL RDAs if not better. Personally, this has me convinced that mesh is the future for subohm tanks. 

Vapor production is also very good. A fluffy and dense cloud up to 80 watts with the .17 ohm coil. And roughly the same with the .18. 

Coil longevity does leave something to be desired though. I got about two weeks with each. After that I started getting a burn flavor from them. 

Overall, I think on the short term the coils are solid but long term isn’t as good. They also guzzle juice like you wouldn’t believe and this I feel is partly due to the huge wicking ports on the coils. 

**wow, that is a solid performer it seems. But that is a lot to read for each. How about a little pros and cons section?**

Sure, I’d say that’s necessary on this one! Let’s start with the pros of the mod itself. 

**pros**

Huge screen

Wattage lock button

Intuitive and easy to navigate 

Responsive touch sensors

Multiple display modes

The screen itself is very nice

The locking button works very well

Great list of settings in the setting menu. 

**cons**

It’s large and heavy, though not excessively so.

Music mode is kind of eh.

The wallpapers are kinda eh, though a few are alright. 

One of the locking modes does not work super well, though there is another better working locking method. 

The fire button requires a little firmer of a press. 

There is a slight learning curve. 

There is a drop in power when at higher wattages at lower battery levels. 

**And now for the tank it comes with.**

**pros**

Great flavor. Better than any subohm tank I have used, though I haven’t used many recent ones. 

Very very respectable vapor production. 

Easy to fill

810 drip tip 

The airflow feels comfortable considering the wattage required. 

Includes both a bubble tank section and a tube tank section 

From what I’ve seen, the coils are reasonably priced. 

**cons**

Coil longevity isn’t great.

Coil can sometimes get stuck in the chimney, though it is easy to get it out. 

No 510 adapter, though a 510 tip may make this an uncomfortable vape/draw. 

**wow, those tank cons don’t look too bad. The mod looks pretty decent too. So what’s the verdict? What are your final thoughts?**

I’ve been diggin this mod. I haven’t come across any major issues in my use of it. It’s a little gimmicky but it gets the job done well aside from the drop in power at higher wattages when the battery is low. But at lower wattages this does go away and perform very well. The tank itself is pretty solid though I’ve found that the coils don’t last the longest time. But they aren’t super expensive either from what I’ve seen so that sorta balances things out. 

Now you all know my philosophy. Don’t take one review as the gospel. Shop around and come to your own informed decision. As it stands I feel comfortable recommending this kit. I think it’s pretty neat and while a little large I feel like it’s overall nice. 

**what would you change about the kit though?**

I’d like a better selection of wallpapers or the ability to upload your own pictures.

I’d like the clock to be a wallpaper and not just a screen saver. 

I’d like the coils to last a little longer. 

I’d honestly get rid of the music mode. 

I’d like Smoant to work out the drop in power, whether that means making the voltage cut off higher or through some other way to make it less noticeable. 

Otherwise I think this is a solid kit.

**wow Anx, you lasted an entire review on a mod called The Naboo without making a star wars reference! I’m really impressed!!**

Mesa girlfriend said shesa would killen mesa if me did  jar jar binks impresseon again :( 

___________________________________________________________

So that’s what I’ve got on the Naboo kit from Smoant. Overall not a bad device. One I’ll likely be using in the future. Definitely going in my recommendations list. Thanks for reading everyone!!! 

As always, an update: I’ve got some other reviews coming up shortly which is always fun. But more importantly, MTL episode 6 is finished and will be coming out soon (most likely this week). 

Anyway, thanks again for reading! Hopefully you found something worth while from this review. Coming up next is the Cthulhu Hastur Mini MTL RTA.

t3_9qpat7,"Naboo Kit Review! 225w Large Display, Dual 18650 Mod + Mesh Sub-Ohm Tank by Smoant - Darksun Vapes","Hello again. Hope everyone is having a good Tuesday! Today I’m going to be reviewing the Naboo mod kit by Smoant*Disclaimer:* I was provided this product for the purpose of this review by Smoant.
________________________________________________

**INTRO**

*Before I start I want to point out that I do several different builds at various resistances all with SS316L to test VW and TC modes for every mod I test. This time I ran a 0.12ohm dual fused clapton (28g*3 + 36g), a 0.21ohm single fused clapton (26g*4 + 36g), a 0.3ohm dual clapton (26g + 30g), a 0.51ohm dual 30g, and a 0.76ohm single twisted 28g. Now to the review!*


The Naboo is Smoant’s new dual 18650 mod. It’s got a huuuge touch screen display with some interesting personal settings. Smoant has had a better than average track record with their kits, and overall the Naboo is another well-made and accurate device with the same Ant225 chip found in other Smoant devices. This kit also comes with a sub ohm tank that utilizes mesh coils. 


The Naboo is a regulated mod with all the bells and whistles of most mods now days plus some. I have tested the mod in and out for almost a full month (27 days) and I am quite pleased with the mod but not so much the tank, mainly the coils.

________________________________________________

**OVERVIEW**

When removed from the packaging the Naboo looks like a twin to many other mods on the market in terms of layout and ergonomics. It was not until I booted it up for the first time that I really noticed the difference. The Naboo has a 2.4” display at an advertised 240x320px (pixel level) and 300dpi resolution. The 2 touch screen buttons at the base are the only touch screen aspects of the device. While the position of these buttons is a plus in my book it would have also been a big negative if it wasn’t for an independent locking button located right below the fire button. When I failed to lock the touch buttons, it was only a matter of time before I accidentally changed the values I had set when using. Having the lock being an easily accessible button was a very simple and great design choice (probably the best overall in my opinion of the Naboo). 


I’ll get more into the features below but the centered 510 spring-loaded pin performed well with several varying rebuildable tanks, personalization such as: custom wallpapers, sufficient vent holes at the base, and the overall shape/design is comfortable to hold and use. As another pro, I have to mention is the user manuals. So many manuals these days just don’t cut it as they provide miss-information or lack of information. Mainly with the mod manual; the layout was good, the pictures were useful, and it included useful information like suggested TCR ranges for various metals.


**NABOO USE**
With the inclusion of the lock button, the Naboo is relatively straight forward to work with. The only issue I had was adjusting the wattage in TC mode but it is explained how to do in the manual. Speaking of wattage, I really disliked how the wattage scrolled in VW mode. It goes up/down in 0.1w increments up until 100w where it goes with full numbers. To make it worse, the auto scroll was very janky to use. It would start of slow then after 2-3sec it would go 10x faster usually causing me to always over/under shoot the desired value. 


The Naboo has a VW, TC (Ni, Ti, SS), and TCR modes with corresponding preheat (temp. curve) functionality with each setting. With all the customization, it includes an advertised music mode. It took me a minute or 2 to realize it sensed the sound around the device and throttled the bars in the display accordingly. With no sound, the bars still fluctuate slightly but if I were to talk the bars would spike and if music is played around it goes along with. It’s kinda cool but it was more of a one-and-done with me. Not because I really disliked it, but because the Naboo in some of its settings really drains the batteries more than I’d like. Honestly with the big display, the added drain is a necessary by-product. By the end of my month-long testing I had turned the brightness all the way down, turned the display setting to the lowest time amount, used wallpaper mode only, and turned off the vibration. Even with all of that done, it still felt like it was still draining my 18650s a tad more than similar large display mods and moderately more than those with very simple/small displays.


**NABOO PERFORMANCE**
The Naboo did do very well in VW and TC mode. With each of the coils I used, the device was on-point accurate with the resistance readings and the output felt right on par or just a little bit over. The TC with SS was pretty spot on as well. I did play with the TCR values, and at the end determined that setting it to a value of 92 for 316L was slightly better than the pre-programed values. I already mentioned the battery drain, so I won’t mention that again.


**NABOO TANK USE**
The Naboo mesh tank is another very basic sub-ohm tank like many others in the market today. It comes with a bubble-style glass which I greatly prefer over the longer glass tank option and a backup option which cuts the capacity in half (for TPD compliance). The airflow is well above what is needed for either coil as I never had it more than 50% open. Finally, it is 810 drip tip compatible but the resin tip that comes with is just fine. Pretty meh and nothing noteworthy overall.


**NABOO TANK PERFORMANCE**
I tested out 3 coils (received one extra from Smoant on top of the 2 that come with the tank) and they all had a very similar and almost identical odd pattern. After the coils were primed and good to go, each one came with a very unsavory break-in taste. Way worse than flax-paper coils, this was quite surprising to me. With the first coil I thought it was a dud as nothing should taste this rank. However, after a full tank the true flavors of the ejuice started coming through. However, once past the break-in period the flavor was right on track and above average. 


So everything was going great for each of the 3 coils. Flavor was good with no signs of changing at 55-70ml each consumed (even one using a super-gunk, sweet blend) but then one day the coil would just crap out. I mean a full 180 degrees good performance to shit. I’ve never had a coil that ran good, good, good, than BAM gets totaled like a switch was flipped. I tried to dissect the last 2 coils but could not cleanly remove the cotton or mesh coil to inspect. My theory is that there was a brittle soft spot on each mesh coil that after a certain amount of juice used caused it to crack/snap/break and causes the coil to heat up in concentrated sections causing unavoidable dry hits 100% of the time. The fact that all 3 coils (2 from the kit and 1 extra) all acted almost identically makes me ponder if there is something seriously wrong in the overall manufacturing process. 

________________________________________________

**CONCLUSION**

The Naboo mod is a great device. The vivid and large screen is very nice especially with all the customization. While the added drain to the batteries is not pleasant, it is the price that is paid for it. I never liked the vibration feature so that went off almost instantly, but at least the brightness and display settings can be adjusted to stretch the charge. The design MVP is truly the independent locking button for the touch buttons. Of course the performance of the Naboo is nothing to knock as well. The only dislike I had was how it dialed in VW mode.


The Naboo mesh tank is a very conventional sub-ohm tank. Nothing really crazy new nor bad about the overall design and use. However, there is a serious problem with the mesh coils. From the funky break-in start to it proverbially shitting the bed at the end, something needs to get looked at. If these issues (more so the latter) are fixed then it’s pretty decent as the flavor was quite good.     

________________________________________________

**PROS**

   * Solid mod performance 

   * Independent lock button 

   * Large and detailed display & Personalization options

   * *Minor* - mod user manual

**CONS**

   * Mesh coils

   * VW wattage scrolling <100w

   * *Minor* - added battery drain due to large display and some settings

________________________________________________

**WOULD I RECOMMEND?**

With the information at hand, the mods is going to get 2 thumbs up and the tank 2 thumbs down from me. I’ll be adding the Naboo mod to my recommended review list. That said, it should be obvious that I would not recommend buying the Naboo kit but just the Naboo mod as a single until whatever issue is worked out with the coils. The display is definitely pretty awesome but just be aware that a few tweaks may be needed to keep a reasonable battery life.

t3_9qnh30,Are there any starter kits that come with an eliquid?,"Ive been trying to get friends and family members who are smokers to switch to vaping for several years now. They are interested, especially when I tell the financial benefits. An average pack of 25 cigarettes in Australia is at minimum, about $US22, due to massive Gov tax.

When they ask about how to purchase an ecig, I start telling about how you can buy everything from Australia vape shops, but you need to purchase nicotine ejuice from overseas.

The thing about a lot of Aussies (not all, but a lot) is that they're not very internet/online shopping inclined. As soon as I begin talking about going to this website and that website, their eyes glaze over and it inevitably ends up with the final question, ""if I give you the cash, can you buy it for me"". It goes against the point of them becoming independent of me,  and its happened so many times that I just dont bother anymore.

I'd love to be able to direct people to a single webpage where they can purchase a starter kit and ejuice, all in one go.

Do any vendors you know offer this? And what's a good one?

I was super pleased with it until I decided to get an Aspire Cleito Tank for it which I felt was worse than the stock tank that my mod had.   



I sold the mod to a friend and it's still going strong to this day.  


Now I wanna buy a new one since I can't stand cigarettes anymore.   


What I'm looking for in my new mod is:


- Easy maintenance. No RBA / RTA or whatever else there is, I just wanna buy some coils and change them every week or so.   
- Cheap maintenance. I don't want to pay more than I already pay for cigarettes monthly which is ~150$.   
- Strong flavor. I mean, the stock tank on this kit that I posted had the perfect balance between cloud production and flavor. I want that again.  
- I still think I want a DTL Tank.

t3_9qm0pw,The Hava Goliath Beetles,"**Disclaimer**

This product was sent to me for review purposes by [Hava](https://havahali.com/).  This fact will not alter my review of the product.

**Introduction**

On today's menu is the Goliath Beetles Kit.  This kit comes in your normal two pieces, the mod and the atomizer, and I will be splitting this review up between the two of them.

&#x200B;

[Here's a nice little album of pictures showing that either I need a good camera or I just lack photography skills.](https://imgur.com/a/ajQXgrM)

&#x200B;

**The Mod**

The Goliath Beetles mod measures at 45x88x31mm and honestly fits wonderfully in my hands.  With a set of batteries in, the mod isn’t exactly light feeling but isn’t exactly heavy feeling either.  Sturdy feeling would be a good way to describe it.  The Goliath Beetles features your normal array of safety features: 10sec overtime protection, short protection, low battery cut-off, and (although not listed) I’ll say reverse polarity protection since I tried putting the batteries in wrong (don’t try this at home!) and nothing happened.

The kit comes in a few very nice colors: Rainbow, Meteor Blue, Burgundy Red, Champagne Gold, and Gun Metal.  I was sent the Rainbow kit for the review and honestly it’s probably the nicest looking mod that I now own.  Being as highly polished as it is, though, it is fingerprint hell.

Two 18650 cells are the powerhouse for this 220W mod, so choose your cells off of Mooch’s chart accordingly.  The battery door is located on the bottom of the mod and is secured with a little sliding latch.  In a great design choice, the latch is ever-so-slightly recessed making it more difficult to accidentally dump the batteries.  In the time that I’ve had the mod, I’ve had zero issues with that occurring.  It’s also worth noting that while it is easy to release the battery door, closing it does take a wee bit of effort.

The “fire” button is located on the upper portion on the side of the mod where your pointer or thumb would naturally rest depending on which hand you were holding the mod with.  The button itself gives a nice click and does not seem to care from what angle you press it.  Normal five clicks on, five clicks off, and 3 clicks to enter the menu.

The top features an offset, spring-loaded, 510 connector with a seemingly well built 510 plate.  One quirk I’ve noticed is occasionally having to poke at the center pin’s insulator in order for the pin to “pop” back up and make connection.  This only occurs once in a while when changing atomizers.  When an atomizer is attached you’ll be greeted with a choice of either “New coil” or “Same coil”.

The front of the Goliath Beetles has an “up” button, a “down” button, a USB port, and a massive monochrome display.  The “up” and “down” buttons both give satisfying clicks and mostly operate without issue.  I will say that occasionally, if you don’t press one of the buttons just right, it will read it as both being pressed which is how you set(lock) the resistance.  The USB port seems to be for charging purposes only.  I reached out to find out if the mod was firmware upgradable but was unable to get an answer.  As I see no downloads available on the company’s website, I’m left to assume that it is not upgradable.  Another interesting note about the USB port is that it is not capable of pass-through charging.  So, if you find yourself in a situation where you’re stuck charging the Goliath Beetles via USB then you better have a backup to use while you wait.  The display itself is extremely easy to read from any angle and at the perfect brightness level.  The display will show you a myriad of things depending on what setting you are using including: Wattage, Temperature, Volts, Resistance, Puffs,  Curve, menu items, and individual battery levels.

The menu is accessed by clicking the “fire” button 3x quickly.  Using “up” and “down” to navigate the menu, options are chosen by pressing “fire”.  The main section of the menu is broken into 4 parts: Power, TC, System, and Exit.

The power section has 4 different choices: Normal, Powerfull (yes with 2 Ls)(this option is stated as adding an additional 10% power and heating rate from normal mode), Bypass, and Curve where you can program in your own custom power curve.  Curve mode is a bit odd to work with.  In curve mode you use the “up” button to move the power level up, but the down button moves the cursor to the next position.  So, if you want to actually decrease the power level for a particular section of the curve, you have to turn it all of the way up and start back from the bottom.  Also odd is that the baseline is 5W, but after that it goes up by increments of 10W.  Curve mode also changes the dual battery display to a single battery icon with a charge percentile next to it.

The TC section features: Ni, Ti, SS, TCR, and Curve.  If Curve is chosen you enter another menu allowing you to choose: Ni, Ti, SS, or TCR.  SS in the instance of this mod is 316, not 316L.  For what it’s worth, I am not a big TC user.  I like the idea, but I enjoy the simplicity of power mode and the natural ramp-up and down of the coils that I’m using.  With that said, I have been using this mod in TC mode for a while, for the sake of this review, and have been overall pleased with the consistency of the vape using just regular SS316L spaced coils that I threw in.  As for the accuracy of the TC, I cannot truthfully comment.  Another oddity: in order to change the wattage applied in TC you have to switch back to power mode, change the wattage, then switch back.

System gives you two options: Clear Puffs and System Reset.  Both being quite self-explanatory.  The sad part is that the manual shows other options such as setting the clock (that it doesn’t have).  My contact informed me that the chip was changed after the manual was written, which does happen occasionally.  Shame though, a clock would have been a nice addition aesthetically.

**The V Tank**

Coming in at 25x46.5mm the V tank comes with a 5ml bulb glass installed and a spare, 3ml, straight glass included in the box.

There are two coils available for the V tank: A 0.15ohm kanthal mesh coil, and a 0.5ohm kanthal single parallel coil in vertical configuration.  The mesh coil comes installed in the tank already and the parallel coil is included in the box.  While I was kind of surprised that they decided to go with kanthal in the case of the mesh coil, the actual performance of the coil was quite acceptable.  The flavor reproduction, once broken in, was quite potent and cloud production was impressive.  Using 70/30VG in both coils for the entirety of this review,  the mesh coil did do a bit more weeping than the parallel coil and did require 2 wipe-downs before I ended up retiring the coil.  Noteworthy though is that the juice I’ve been using usually requires me to rebuild my coils about once a week, both the mesh and the parallel coils held up extremely well.  In fact, I’ve still got the parallel coil installed and it’s still producing great flavor.

The V tank utilizes your normal twin cyclops bottom airflow slots.  The airflow ring moves very smoothly and holds its position without issue.

The tank is top-fill simply by unscrewing.  The drip tip is 810 and there is no 510 adapter, though using a 510 drip tip on this tank probably wouldn’t work out too well.

I asked if there was an RBA, or plans for an RBA, for this tank but received no answer.  So, I’m left to assume that this tank does not have one and probably will not get one sadly.  I love the matchy-matchy but if I can’t rebuild it, to the shelf it shall go.

**Conclusion, things worth noting, and suggestions to Hava**

Overall this mod has been extremely reliable thus far but that’s not to say that it isn’t without its quirks.  I honestly love the looks of this kit, both in design and in color(s).  The weight is great.  The fire button works like a charm.  The display is nice, large, and easy to read.  And I love the recessed battery latch.

One mind-blowing thing is it’s memory, or sort of memory.  When you switch out the batteries expect to have to put your settings back in, it’ll drop it back into power mode at 5W...but it’ll still remember how many puffs you took.  Not really a deal-breaker, but a mild annoyance.  Having to occasionally push the insulator on the 510 down is also mildly annoying.  Having to pop into power mode to change the wattage applied in TC mode is a hassle.  Another strange thing is that there is no button lock function, the mod is either on or off.  Although when you shut it off it says ""Bye bye"" which is a cute touch.

The manual is one of the best I’ve ever read in terms of being in plain English.  One of those things that doesn’t matter all too much but is still really nice.  One interesting point though is that, in the TCR section, it lists the TCR values for gold.  Are people vaping gold coils now?  Did I miss this train?

If something has a USB port, utilize it.  I truly hope this mod is firmware upgradable and that a firmware upgrade will be available.  Either add in the missing, listed, functionality in the manual or update the manual.  Either way, having an upgrade that fixes the issue of the mod forgetting what settings you were vaping at would be most welcome.  Pass-through charging has been around for years now and should be standard by this point. The fact that this mod does not support that made me chuckle.

The V tank not having an RBA is disappointing but that’s a personal preference thing so I can’t really weigh that.  Just my opinion.

The kit is available directly from [Hava](https://havahali.com/) for $99.99 but can be found for as low as $74.95.  With the quirks currently present, I personally feel that price is a bit on the high side of things but again that’s just my feelings on the subject.  Fix those few quirks and this thing would honestly be worth the asking price.

The coils are available directly from [Hava](https://havahali.com/) and elsewhere for $19.95 for a 5 pack of either style.

t3_9qlsl5,Looking for something to replace my JUUL,"Hey guys,

Been vaping for a while and used to be fairly into mods but switched to juul when it first entered the market. 

I’m finally just getting sick of the flavors/price and want to get back into something that will allow me to try new things. 

Big wants are as small of a form factor as I can get with maximum performance. Would prefer to stick with salt based nic juice if that matters.

t3_9qkvfa,DIY juice tips? Also a couple of questions,"Hey there, not 100% sure this is the right place to ask this, but if not maybe somebody can point me in the right direction. I've been vaping for a few years and finally decided I'll be making my own vape juice. I have not in the past, but if you look at my post history I have lots of experience making PG solutions with substances that aren't nicotine. I'm familiar with proper PPE, ventilation, etc. However I know little about vape related stuff. I buy my juice and coils and keep the settings on my vape the same, so I bet a lot of my terminology is going to be off here.

Anyways, I think I'm on the right track with my plan, I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything important. I plan on making a 75%/25% VG/PG solution with 6mg/mL of nicotine. Not sure about how much juice I'll be making so I'll just say 100mL for calculations.

* Measure 25mL of PG in a graduated cylinder, pour into beaker

* Measure 6mL of [this](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/purnic-100mg-smooth-nicotine-salts) 100mg/mL ""smooth"" nicotine salt solution in a syringe, put into beaker with pg

* Measure 69mL VG in graduated cylinder, pour into same beaker

* Add flavor

* Put beaker on magnetic stirrer for like an hour or two (wouldn't this also kinda breath it too? not sure about that terminology I've just seen it for the first time today)

* Pour finished juice into sealed glass amber vial to steep

Anyways, assuming that process sounds good, I also have a couple of questions. 

* How much flavoring should I add per my example? I was planning on using [this strawberry](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/capella-sweet-strawberry?variant=15266070275) flavoring to start with because I'm not picky on flavor, but I'd also love suggestions!

* How much juice should I make before testing it out? My girlfriend and I will both be trying it so I was thinking like 30-50mL or so, but not sure what a normal amount would be for testing. 

* Is nicotine salt available as just the salt? I have only seen it available as a solution such as the product I saw above. I can definitely use the pre-made solutions but I would rather just make my own. 

* Just out of curiosity, what kind of salt is ""Nicotine salt"" usually? the [website](https://www.nicotineriver.com/) I've been listing has different catagories, such as ""PurNic"" ""Smooth"" and ""Glass"", what would the difference be?

* Is PEG 400 worth looking into? I'm already very familiar with PG and have used VG in almost all of my purchased juices, but I don't know much about PEG.

* Finally, is the site I linked to reputable? I've only bought juice from my brick and mortar vape store so I have no clue what to look for in a reputable vendor

Anyways sorry for such a long post, I'm excited to start experimenting with juices and want to make sure I do it right, so any information is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Just wanted to add that I'm more interested in mixing my own juice for cost reasons, I'm very easy to please with juice choices. So while I will be experimenting with different flavor options once I get comfortable making juice I'm fine with cheap generic stuff to start with",Mon Oct 22 19:53:15 PDT 2018,50kent

t3_9qks96,PIZZA DAVE DELIVERS - AN AIO REVIEW - THE NS PEN BY VANDY VAPE,"  

Hello everyone, Pizza Dave here, delivering you a review of the NS Pen by [Vandy Vape](http://vandyvape.com/). This compact all in one device features a built in 650mah battery, magnetic drip tip cover, 1.5ml capacity, and 3 output levels. Let’s dive down and look at what makes the NS Pen the NS Pen, and as always, I will see you down at the bottom for my final thoughts.

DISCLAIMER: This device was sent to me by [Vandy Vape](http://vandyvape.com/) for review.

**OPERATION**

The NS Pen is a compact and simple device to operate. Like most devices on the market, 5 clicks of the fire button will turn it on, and another 5 clicks will turn it off. A caveat to this device is it also has 3 different output voltages. With 3 clicks of the fire button (once powered on) it will cycle between White, Green, and Red which indicate voltage settings. White is 3.8v, green is 3.6v, and red is 3.4v. I didn’t notice a huge difference between these, but it is noticeable. I will talk about them a bit more in the how it vapes section. The manual lists a handful of fault/protection LED indications which include Over-vaping (10s or more), No-atomizer, Short-circuit, and low-power. I did not find any sort of indication that shows a real time output of battery level which is a huge let down. All that will happen is you can be vaping along, having a grand old time, then boom, the red led flashes 10 times and you must plug it in. Before we wrap up the operation portion, I will touch on refills. The top cap unscrews to reveal two small fill ports. I never had issues filling with smaller tipped bottles, but dropper bottles will make a mess. On the bright side, this device sips on liquids and refills are spread out a ways, but it can be a messy refill if you are a dropper bottle user.

**HOW IT VAPES**

The vape that this provides is right in the ball park of some of today’s tighter drawing pod systems. The vapor production is low, but the flavor is on point. One of my favorite nic salt liquids is a 70/30 ratio, so there are times when this is too thick for the wicking in pod systems and all in ones, but the NS pen had zero issues keeping up. I chain vaped it continually and it never gave me a dry hit. The air flow is not adjustable, so what you get is what you get, and it provides a mouth to lung hit that is more on the restricted side. I think it is a great draw personally as a device like this should be a bit tighter due to the market it is placed. My preferred mode was the higher output “white” setting as I got a little flavor from it. I did a blind test to see if I could actually tell what mode it was in, and while it wasn’t a huge difference, the white did pop out more to me. One con popped up when chain vaping on this in all modes (white being the worst), and it came in the form of heat. The tank section as well as the top of the mod get very hot and nobody likes a hot device.

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I have used a few devices that have a similar form factor to this, but they didn’t perform as well as this one does. There are new pod systems and all in ones coming out every week, and this one stands out based on its style and form factor. It has a fair share of pros, but also has a handful of cons. The first con is the lack of a real time battery level. I get battery anxiety when a device doesn’t let me know where it is at. In turn, I always end up charging them every chance I can. Another con is the heat produced by the atomizer when chain vaping as I mentioned above. It isn’t bad for casual vaping, but it was noticeable when chain vaping. The last con is that this does have glass, and glass can break. It is protected well by the metal on the outside and would take a serious drop to break it, but it can be broken, and it would render this mod useless. I like that this has a drip tip cover, but the design is rounded, so if you place it on the bottom of the mod it won’t stand upright. Minor design con and not a deal breaker by any means. Some pros for this include flavor, which is satisfying and smooth. I never had coil issues at all either which is a huge pro considering the luck I had with their last all in one. No gurgling, flooding, leaking, or early burn out. It wicks well even with 70/30 e-liquid. It offers power modes for those who might want to turn it down up or down a hair. Battery life, as well as liquid capacity are adequate to get through a full day for me. It might not be the same for everyone, but it lasted for me. Overall, Vandy Vape put out a decent all in one device for those who want to start out vaping. I like that this is a cylindrical style device, as I have had friends (who smoke) ask me why many of the starters these days are designed in odd shapes. They felt more comfortable holding something that is shaped like a cigarette, so I think it is fitting that a starter has this shape. 

&#x200B;

**THE OVEN TEST**

If this one accidentally went into the pizza oven, would I go out and buy another? Like I said on some other pod/starter kids, probably not. Not because it is bad or anything, but just because there will be another one out next week in this market.

REVIEW CRITERIA: I use each item for about two weeks to ensure I have collected enough data to adequately write a review. I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used it enough to give an educated review. The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying it and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \*\*\*\*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.",Mon Oct 22 19:41:32 PDT 2018,pizzadave80

I'm starting to think that it's the quality of the wire, but I have no clue tbh. I use the Master of Clouds brand. The chest pains don't go away until I change out the coil entirely.

t3_9qhxrd,Best leak proof RTA?,"So I've looked at the list by Anthony Vapes and noted that there are three single coil RTA that are leak proof: vapefly Horus, Augvapes intake, and kaess Solomon 2. Also probably worth debating the geekvape Zeus, but I can't decide whether the double coil is worth considering. Which one would you consider the most bang for your buck?

 I feel like I am a straight to the lung type vaper but never really figured that out. 

I have been using the griffin 25 RTA for a couple years and my main problem is that it leaks like no other. Im mainly looking for an RTA that gets a good amount of flavor and is leak resistant.

t3_9qhvb4,"Been out of the loop for a while and just bought a new mod, this post is not about that but the new pod device I have seen","So I have been shopping around for a replacement squonk mod and going to the B&Ms and the internet, then back again. Having not been in the market for two years I noticed these pod devices have appeared on the market.

And I am surprised that these are allowed in a world when disposable plastics are being faught against. I can see why they exist, we have stupid laws that reduce tanks sizes and refill options but should these be promoted over other devices? I would rather they were not, they they are wasteful, over engineered and cost more than they should, a glass refill option with replaceable coil should be our default recommendation IMO. Anything other than disposable plastics please.

t3_9qhus8,revenger x probs and firmware date,"bought a revenger x from a reputable online store, in the mod's ""system -> version"" it says ""Ver 1.01 20171207"", on vaporesso's web site revenger x fw says '20171020_V1.01'.  so same version number, older date than what my mod says.  the timestamp on the rom file in the zip is oct. 18 so the zip file's name isn't a mistake.

I want to reflash but am guessing the 1207 fw is possibly a newer version only available during production.  and from what I can tell there's no way to save fw already in the mod before reloading the web site's version so basically I'd end up going backwards if I reflash.

the problem is haptic feedback has never worked one single time, I have no idea how this unit ever got past qc.  I use two sets of genuine samsungs, tried resetting to factory defaults a couple times, running the ""system -> vibration"" level up and down, nothing.

second issue is misfires around 5% of the time, if I hold the mod only by the frame around the edge and let nothing near the capacitive buttons it still misfires so it seems unrelated to a conflict with those buttons.

I don't know if these are electrical problems or not so was hoping to reflash to see if it's software issues.  but like I say I don't really want to go backwards on fw and possibly end up with even worse problems like the flashing screen issue I've seen in others.

t3_9qhjkm,So atomizers completely change the flavor you get from the same juice?,"I apologize in advance if this is a silly or obvious question. I've been vaping for a little under two months now and I'm just very curious in general.

I like a piña cream juice that's basically a piña colada minus the menthol. I was vaping it with a Dead Rabbit SQ, which really highlighted the pineapple and citric notes, but today I got a Drop and now my juice tastes creamier, sweeter and the coconut is a lot more pronounced, while the pineapple is barely noticeable.

It's funny because I thought the atomizer would only make it taste more muted or pronounced as a whole, not completely change how it's balanced. Is this something more experienced vapers always get when trying new atties? Could this difference be due to the bigger chamber, different airflow, dual coil configuration, higher wattage or something else completely? Am I building the Drop right? Any insight on this would be appreciated.

t3_9qfz8w,Ohms jumping around on your atomizer? Let my foolishness be your guide.,"I recently acquired a Steam Crave Glaz RTA and a Slam Piece. Lovely pairing IMHO. Vape's been nice. But the last 2 times I put new coils in I had this issue where all my regulated mods and my ohm reader all say different things. Sometimes wildly different things. Two of them always agreed on a number that was in safe range for a mech. I checked, and the 510 pin was in as far as it could go...but.

The positive post on this thing was solid as far as I knew. But last night I was swapping new coils in and a leg got stuck. When I pulled it out with a little force the positive post was a'wigglin and a'floppin about! I exaggerate, it was loose-ish but definitely not making a solid connection, and it could move about a millimeter, maybe two. I thought I broke something. I backed the 510 pin all the way out, disassembled everything, gave it a good clean while I had it apart, then put it all back together, making sure I pushed down on the positive post section while screwing in the 510. Viola'! All readings exactly where they should be and everything vaping nicely.

I assume I was at risk of a hard short had that loose post shifted in use and a coil touched something it shouldn't have. I also assume that the Glaz chimney section is maybe a contributing reason why I didn't get any short.

I want a tank I can use with ~60-80 watts. Not too concerned about HUGE clouds, but want good flavor. Also, I want something that doesn’t absolutely blow through juice. On the same note, I want it to be economical with a decent coil life to coil price ratio. 

This will be a vape I throw in my pocket and be carrying with me a lot so no juice leakage is a priority. 

I’ve been looking at getting an ijoy diamond or captain kit just for starters because they come in at such a good price point, but I don’t hear much about their tanks. 
I’ve heard good things about the valerian as well as the Fireluke series, but worry about blowing through juice. 
Lately I’ve been using a cleito 120. I’m mostly impressed by it asides from that it leaks slightly and you have to constantly unscrew the top so that the pressure equalizes as juice is consumed.

So something mouth to lung I’d want and I don’t really want something big like most experienced vapers have, ive looked and then there is something like pod system or so I got told about the breeze was a good one. Everyone here knows better than me what to get so, mouth to lung, not really big at all, and I think something I can fill different juices in to. And a little bit of a cloud would be cool to I guess.

t3_9qflez,My experience with Aspire PockeX,"**This post was originally posted with a wrong device name. Thanks to** /u/Sighfu **for the tip.**

&#x200B;

I bough an Aspire PockeX vape a few days ago and I've suffering a lot of issues from the very beginning: flooding all the time, non-stop gurgling and spitting, hot drops in my mouth 8/10 times...

&#x200B;

After ruining a bunch of coils and spending a decent amount of time researching all over the internet, and seeing that there's a lot of people having similar issues, I'd like to share what I've learned so far (worth to say that it's my very first vaping device after more than 20 years smoking so my background/knowledge about vaping is near zero; if I'm saying some stupidity please let me know!):

* Move to high vg liquids. I started with 40vg and seems that the PockeX coils (0.60 ohms) are not happy with those levels (liquid is not thicker enough so it's not properly vaporised then flooding happens). I Moved to 70vg 6mg nic and works great, didn't try 60/40 but some people says it works fine too.
* Prime your coils properly the very first time you use them. I've found a lot of contradictory opinions about this all over the internet. After talking with the staff from my nearest vape shop, what is working for me is putting 3-4 drops of e-liquid on the coil's top hole. **That's all**. Definitely don't prime the airflow hole which is on the side right below the top one (don't confuse with the two ""cotton-holes"" located at the bottom of the coil, which are going to be primed when the coil is in contact with the juice).
* Don't exceed the max level on the tank. Once screwing the cap (including the coil) put the device vertically and wait a few minutes to let the cotton absorb the e-liquid (mine is ready in no more than 10 minutes). After that you can try to blow in a few times when the device is still off to help the coil to be fully primed and/or expel extra liquid, if any.

&#x200B;

In doing so, my PockeX is now working like a charm 100% of the time: no gurgling, no spitting, no hot drops in my mouth, no puffing for a while before firing the button, no headache dealing with paper towels every time I refill, absolute amazing flavour, and so on. So basically what I expect for an AIO entry level device.

&#x200B;

Finally, if you notice that the top cap is running too hot after installing a new coil, I'll recommend you to replace it immediately (probably the coil is defective, it happened to me with the very first one). Otherwise you are going to run into some (if not all) of the problems mentioned above.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps if you are having troubles with this or a similar device.",Mon Oct 22 09:46:53 PDT 2018,davidmarcoes
t3_9qfhwp,Anthony Vapes: Cthulhu 1928 MTL RDA Review,"Hi All, Anthony Vapes back here with my review of the Cthulhu 1928 MTL RDA, please see the bottom for disclaimers and links. Note: This is not marked as a sample version 


##Introduction:
 
 
The Cthulhu 1928 MTL RDA is the latest RDA from somewhat well known manufacturer Cthulhu Mods. I’ve reviewed quite a few of their products to date and they have been hit and miss for the most part. They’ve made some really good MTL stuff like the hastur RTA, hastur mini RTA, and their DTL azeroth RDA last year i enjoyed, but also had some stinkers like the M RDA and Zathog RDA. The 1928 RDA is a single coil 22mm MTL RDA with an included squonk pin. It’s available in 2 colors, Black, and SS.  I see it online only in china around the 20 USD price range so very nice price point as well. 

 
##Manufacturer's Specs

* 1928 MTL RDA is design for true MTL and nic salts vaping.
* 0.8mm, 1.2mm, 1.6mm, 2.0mm airflow holes for tight/loose MTL vapers.
* Add dome to the top cap to reduce chamber space and better throat hit.
* One of the smallest chamber RDA on the market.
* Squonk Friendly (avoid over squonking design)
* Raised building deck to make sure no flavor loss.
* Smooth bottom airflow
* Two 3.5mm drip tips
* 24k gold-plating positive pin
* 7.5mm deep juice well
* About the name: The short story “The Call of Cthulhu“, published in the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. 90th Anniversary.
* WIDTH: 22 mm / 0.86 in
* HEIGHT: 25.5 mm / 1 in (without drip tip)
* Net weight: 0.04kg
* Gross weight: 0.07kg





##Included in box:
 
* 1 Cthulhu MOD 1928 MTL RDA
* 1 extra 510 drip tip
* 1 squonk pin
* Spare o-rings tools








##Picture Album

[album](https://imgur.com/a/g1fwBDa) 


##Initial Impressions
 
When I first got this RDA it was pretty impressed by it. I like their simple round tin packaging and the included cloth bad inside but mostly i liked the deep juice well. Lots of RDAs these days don’t really have deep juice wells especially MTL ones since squonking is the new rage. Outside of that though it’s a pretty basic RDA. They included 2 drip tips but I didn’t care for the super tall one but it gave me flashbacks to 2012 when people used really tall tips (anyone remember the omega RDA lol) but yeah overall not really my style but a nice designed RDA


 
##Build Deck and Wicking (pics above)
 
Let’s talk about the build deck now. This is one thing i’m not majorly impressed with. Not to say it doesn't work as it does work, and is easy to build but it’s a simple parallel screws and your leads just go under the screw heads and get tightened down on the posts. It’s made for MTL so it’s a small deck, not a lot of room but more than enough for a good MTL build. The screws are decent quality phillips screws, would have liked to see better screws here personally and maybe an option for flat head as well. But it works good enough for the purpose. I just felt using screw heads as the connection point is a bit old school and having holes staggered would have been better. Your coil leads do need to be wrapped at opposite ends as the posts are across from each other. Overall it works well and is easy to build but feels a bit outdated to me and the screws could be better. 


Wicking on it is quite easy. It’s an RDA so nothing fancy just drop your leads to the bottom. There are cutouts for the wicks that don’t close off the deck completely however. 


##Performance

Performance wise, I used it as a Single Coil RDA only as intended. I ran 4 builds in this a fancy 3mm ID build, and 3 round builds between 2-3mm ID. Really not an RDA made for large builds obviously since it’s MTL. Flavorwise it’s got good flavor for a MTL RDA and worked well with all sizes of builds i put in it. I think most people would prefer the 2 or 2.5mm ID as it gives a little more wiggle room but 3mm worked good as well which is the max you can fit. All depends on which air setting you want to use and how tight of a draw your going to use. Overall a good flavor RDA for MTL vaping.


 
##Overall Impressions, Details, and Extras
 
Let’s talk about the airflow now. It’s a standard side airflow RDA with 4 small holes on one side only. You can only use 1 hole at a time so there are 4 settings in total. The lowest setting is a loose MTL vape while the highest setting is a very restrictive DTL vape. Good range but not for those who want a super tight draw. Adjusting the airflow is easy. You just spin the whole top cap and the o-rings are a nice size to make it easy to do. There is no texture for grip but since it’s the whole top ap it’s very easy to adjust on a mod but can’t be done on off a mod. The top cap does lock into place as well and all the way one side is the smallest air setting and all the way the other side is the largest air setting so very well done there, and it makes it very easy to screw on and off your mod. The top cap o-rings are good and it’s easy to pop off and on after you lube them up. Mine was very tight at the start and hard to get of and my o-rings also shedded quite a bit, this should have been done better. After i cleaned up the shedding and lubed them up though they worked great so maybe just a little too thick at first. I will ding them for that though.


 It comes with 1 standard 510 o-ringed fit delrin drip tip and 1 standard 510 o-ringed fit tall metal drip tip. I wasn’t a fan of the tall metal one and it reminded me a bit of the omega RDA back in the days. The Drip tip fits a little too snug as well and is hard to get out and in. The o-rings should have been a little smaller. Other oring 510 tips fit well though that i tried. The quality on the Cthulhu 1928 MTL RDA is overall good. After lubing them up, the o-rings for the top cap onto the base feel right and the top cap is snug but not tight. Very easy to take apart with no issues. The AFC is easy to adjust, the o-rings fit just right and everything is nicely done. The post screws are just ok quality though and 2 spare screws are included (all phillips screws). It comes with a standard 510 pin and a BF 510 pin like most RDAs these days as well.

The juice well on this RDA is massive. Bigger then most 24mm dual coil RDAs i’ve used recently. Plenty of room for extra juice so well done there. The over squonk protection is great but dripping down the drip tip can cause leaks, it’s best to pop off the top cap and fill the juice well instead which may annoy some. Thankfully due to the size though and being MTL you won’t have to refill the well often. I only used it as a dripper as i’m not currently working on a review for any squonk mods but i did put it on a squonk mod just to test it real quick and it worked well. 

It’s a 22mm diameter so should not overhang on most mods on the market today. Accessory wise, There is plenty of spare o-rings and 2 spare post screws, 1 allen wrench, 1 extra 510 tip but no cotton or coils. Good amount of accessories overall. The only thing I feel missing would be a coil or 2 and some cotton but not a big deal. Branding is non existent. No visible branding on the outside at all which is nice but it does look a little plain but i’d rather have plain then a crazy giant logo so no complaints there.


##Pros: 
 
* 2 Standard 510 o-ring drip tips (metal and delrin)
* standard 510 pin and squonk pin included
* plenty of spare o-rings
* post screw quality is good enough but not great
* Good over squonk protection
* good flavor for MTL
* Massive sized juice well
* good build quality
* good easy to adjust AFC 
* good airflow options
* nice looks, not overly branded
* Price point (around 20 USD)





 
##Cons:
 
* no cotton or coils included
* lack of Color Options 
* not good for dripping down the center (should be filled by taking off top cap and filling into the juice well)
* build deck should be better
* should have included some non phillips screw options
* top cap was too tight from the factory and o-rings shedded

 
##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this RDA?I don’t like to do a hard yes or no, but this one leans a little towards the yes. There aren’t a lot of good MTL RDAs on the market really. Mostly just the galaxies and ammit that I’ve come across. I don’t think it’s better overall then the galaxies or ammit but i think all 3 are similar. This has the biggest juice well of the 3 and better over squonk protection than the galaxies, but better flavor then the ammit so i feel it’s a viable choice just like the other 2. I’ll be adding this to my sheet of recs linked down below



This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

t3_9qf1kp,I'd like to know which Aspire Breeze Coil type + Juice combinations have worked for you guys.,"I've recently purchased the Breeze 1 and am disappointed as it hasn't worked out too well. The coils have all flooded or burnt out within 1-2 days. I've tried 1 box each of all three types of coils on a 50/50 Naked Salt Brain Freeze juice. I've searched on this subreddit to see some mixed experiences with the Breeze coils. From what I've read so far, the 0.6 coils anecdotally fare better than the 1.0 and 1.2 ohms ones with juices slightly higher vg/pg ratios but below 70/30.

I'm switching out my juice to see if that makes any difference to my experience. So I'm making this a post to specifically so that you guys can hopefully share with me the successful/unsuccessful experiences with combination of coil type (ohm) and juice type (vg/pg, brand name, mg nicotine).

t3_9qefk0,Average Vaper [Review] - Think Vape Thor,"---

Hello ECR! Today I am reviewing for you the [Think Vape Thor](http://www.thinkvapetech.com/thor-200w-mod/)! Think Vape have mainly been know for their Finder DNA device and seem to have a solid reputation with that. The Thor is a bit of a departure from the DNA powered devices they have released in the past. Does the Thor live up to it's godly namesake, or has the time of Ragnarok come? Read below for my evaluation.

I have used the [Thor](https://imgur.com/oIcGPRx.jpg) for 3 weeks now and feel I can give a fair assessment of its quality.

**Thor**

The Think Vape Thor is small, lightweight device with some very interesting skin options. I have noticed this type of device gaining a lot of popularity over the past several months and I can see why. The size is perfect for a dual 18650 device and the lightweight aspect is very appealing without translating into feeling cheap. The Thor may be lacking a bit when it comes to features, but definitely seems to be mostly a solid performer, especially at its price range. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's jump off this review and start at the best place possible: the top.

**Top/510:** The Thor houses a 24mm 510 plat that, surprise surprise, houses 24mm attys. There are a few more mms between the edge of the plate and the edge of the device, so 26mm attys should fit with no issue. The threading is smooth and the positive pin is super spring-loaded.

---

**Buttons:** Travel down the front of the Thor and you have a tinted, plastic screen protector inlay that takes up most of the front of the device. The fire buttons, +/- buttons, and USB charge port are encorporated into the inlay. The fire button is a large, textured rectangular button that is raised a few mms from the device making it easy to locate with your thumb. Towards the bottom of the inlay are your +/- buttons that are black plastic and a decent size. They also protrude at least a few mms from the device and there is no issue depressing them. All buttons have a good clickyness to them.

---

**Screen/Menu:** The screen on the Thor is pretty simplistic but has all the information you need to see, like dual-battery indicators, ohms, voltage, wattage and puff count. I would like to have seen a percentage indicator for the battery indicators, though, and maybe a bit of color. There is really no menu to talk about with the Thor. You click the fire button 3 times to cycle through modes and that's really it. There's no TCR adjustment, Power/TC curve, changing brightness, or anything like that, and the only real ""shortcut"" function is holding + and - while in TC mode to adjust wattage. Personally, I don't mind the simplicity. I don't tend to use Power/TC curve, so just having functioning Power and TC modes is usually enough for me.

One thing that was initially concerning for me is, aside from taking the batteries out of the device, there is no way to turn it off. If you have batteries in the device it stays on at all time and the only thing you can do is lock it. I was unsure about this as I worried about idle battery drain. So I let the device sit on for 3 days to see what kind of impact this had on my batteries. Surprisingly, after 3 days of sitting on there was no change in my battery levels. This was a nice surprise as it was my biggest concern about not being able to shut it off. I'm still not a huge fan of not being able to turn off the device, but it's nice to know the impact on my batteries is negligible.

---

**Battery Compartment:** The entire back of the device comes off to reveal the battery compartment. The door is secured to the device with two fairly strong magnets, one on top and one on bottom. Because of the placement of the magnets on the door it can only fit on the device one way. The compartment has a decent sized battery ribbon for extracting batteries, spring loaded contacts on the bottom, and battery orientation is clearly marked.

---

**Size/Styling:** The main draw for the Thor has to be its size and styling. It's one of the smallest dual 18650 devices I have used, and one of the lightest as well. Even with two batteries installed, it's still ridiculously light. While there are no real ergonimic features to talk about as it's essentially just a rectangular device, the edges are very rounded making it extremely comfortable to hold. The ""skins"" available for the Thor are quite interesting as well. I really like the grafiti style that has gained a lot of popularity, so the Thor is right up my alley. The ""skins"" appear to be printed onto the device and have a smooth, rubbery texture to them. If you're not a fan of any of the ""skins,"" Think Vape have also released Chrome variants that look pretty good as well. They do, however, look to be finger print magnets.

---

**Performance:** The Thor performed mostly well throughout the time I used it. Power Mode is just great! I've had the FreeMax Mesh Pro, StageVape Venus, Drop Dead, and VapeFly Pixie on it and performance was great throughout. It hits hard and fast like an eager teenager. When it comes to TC mode, though, it falls short. I tried using my standard 26x30 SS AVS claptons but it just would not heat them at all. I went with a smaller SS wire and it was finally heating it up, yet it seemed like there was no dry hit detection. Gonna have to mark TC on the Thor down as a fail.

---

---

**Final Thoughts**

**Pros**

* Up to 26mm without overhang
* Smooth 510 threading
* Spring-loaded 510
* Large fire button
* Clicky buttons
* Plenty of displayed information
* Idle battery drain doesn't appear to be an issue
* Strong Magnets on battery door
* Clearly marked battery orientation
* Small size
* Super lightweight
* Plenty of ""skin""/color options
* Great Power Mode performance

**Cons**

* Would like to see battery percentage indicators
* Lack of features/personalization
* While it isn't an issue for batteries, I would like to be able to turn my device off when not in use
* TC Mode performance

&nbsp;

The Thor has a few issues that need to be worked out for it to be an all-around great device. However, if you're looking for a fantastic Power pusher that's super small, super lightweight, and dual 18650 then the Thor definitely will satisfy. For the price range it's at, I can't really argue too much about it's lack of features as you're still getting a superb Power driver. I do wish TC mode worked well.

Think Vape are also currently about to release their Thor Pro which incorporates a larger, color screen and an upgraded chipset. The ""skins"" have also been upgraded. If TC has been worked out, the Thor Pro could easily become one of my favorite devices.

**About**

I say this is an Average Vaper Review because I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who has been vaping for a while (8 years), but doesn't get too in-depth with the technical aspects of the products. I'm evaluating these products as to how well they work out the box, their ease of use, and whether or not they hold up over the course of use. I don't have the skill set to produce thorough testings of the electronics and I defer that to those better suited. This review is purely my experience using the items I received.

t3_9qe6ho,Coil/ tank question,I just started vaping to replace cigarettes like a month ago. I started with the Smok prince baby stick and upgrade to an aegis legend but am still using the same tank from the smok prince baby. I think it’s called the baby beast or something. I’ll tell you guys I have had nothing but trouble with this tank/ coils. It seems with this tank if I don’t seal it up in just the right way all my juice will leak out within an hour. Also these smok baby v8 could suck I bought a box of them too and so far two of them were broken right out of the box and would not properly screw into my atomizer no matter how patient I would be. So basically I’m looking for a better tank recommendation and am wondering if I could buy different coils for this smok tank.,Mon Oct 22 07:12:29 PDT 2018,Janglysack

I dunno if it's the way the Dripper is designed, but so far I haven't had any luck gettinf the flavor I'm accustomed to, like I would with Drop, Dead Rabbit and Drop Dead.

Could it be that the shower heads design is getting in the way of the Vapor's path? Does anyone have any suggestions? ",Mon Oct 22 06:35:10 PDT 2018,wayhik
t3_9qdkpa,Is it safe to vape on?,"So on my mod (Minikin v2) the battery spring was loose and the mod wouldn't start beacuse of that. I solved the problem by putting some white adhesive gum (a thing like Blu Tack) on the top side of the battery slot that were loose (see picture). The adhesive it self do not touch anything vital (like the chipset or any wires, it only touches the plastics inside). Everything seems to work fine, by that i mean like the device it self doesn't turn off by it self like it used to do before. Also took a few hits. Yet i haven't encounterd any problems. So my question is: Is it safe to vape on it?

t3_9qcb49,A true fix for the TFV12 coils,"After many hours of searching for a possible fix as to why my TFV12 Prince kept leaking all it's juice out the bottom air holes I found an easy fix. 

When looking at the bottom of the coil there is a gasket. In and around that gasket are little ends of the wires that prevent that gasket from sealing correctly. Using a mini flathead screwdriver I was able to push the exposed wires behind the gasket and allow it to seal. I also used a pliers to better clamp the two ends together.

Hope this helps, I know I spent more than a few hours to find this fix. ",Mon Oct 22 02:51:29 PDT 2018,Ephino
t3_9qbx5r,Feeling cheated by my local vape shops - 18650 battery’s,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been Vaping for a month with a Pico 25 starter kit with the ELLO tank. When I first bought it I didn’t know the 18650 battery’s , so I asked which would be the most suitable for my mod. He told me that the Sony VTC6 were the ideal ones. Not knowing anything about 18650 I believed in him and bought it. Then I felt the need of having an extra battery with me, read some safety guidelines for noobs and went on another shop to buy an extra battery (in this vape shop they also recommended me the VTC6 ) and a external charger (nitecore d2, after some research I concluded it was a well built and safe to use charger) 

Now, I’ve been researching 18650 battery’s info, and found moochs videos on YouTube. On his ep3 minding your mahs, he talks about some equations and I found out that for my Pico 25 mod the VTC6 18650 do not have the amps I need (15A to 20A IF BELOW 80*). And besides this he tells us that it’s dangerous to use batteries that do not have the amps my mod requests. 

Now, everything is working fine. And maybe I’m just being over careful. But shouldn’t my local shop owners warn me about this?

The Eleaf specs say that a 25A continuous discharge is needed. 

My regulator chip on the Pico 25 is always requesting 75watts from my battery right? 

I conclude that the battery that is most indicated for me is the VTC5. 

Am I thinking straight?

t3_9qay7s,Any other former closet smokers? Wish I discovered this earlier..,"Believe it or not I've been a closet smoker for almost a decade, or at least tried my best to be. The few times I was caught I just played it down as though it was something I do very rarely. The amount of stress that put me under was something I only fully realized  when I got my vaporizer 3 days ago (I switched from cigarettes immediately). Constantly sneaking out on my work break and then washing the smell off, stressing about if someone got in my car (I smoked rollies which got tobacco everywhere), panicking if someone knocked on my door and I had cigarette butts on my verandah or smelt like smoke, hesitating about going on on trips with family or friends because I knew it would be stressful trying to sneak a cigarette, etc etc.   
   

Damn this is so liberating, all of that stress is gone! That's not even mentioning the stress from the actual harmful effects of the smoking itself. I tried to eat well and take supplements to try to convince myself I was counteracting most of the health effects but deep down I knew what I was doing to myself. I had always avoided fully reading about the harmful effects of cigarettes because it would stress me out too much. Now I'm fully diving into it all to use as inspiration to stay off tobacco. I had gradually started smoking more and more over the last few years but seeing as I smoked very short rollies and purchased tobacco in bulk I tried to convince myself I wasn't smoking THAT much even as my purchases became more frequent and I went through more and more papers. Despite all of that I just KNEW I could never stop smoking, I never even attempted it because I just get too much satisfaction and relief from it.   
   

I had heard of vaping a bit in the last few years but I didn't bother trying because of my experience with one of those cig-a-likes I got off ebay about 6 years ago. I was so excited to get that thing in the mail so I could quit but after a few puff's I don't think I even touched it again. I was so nervous when I got my vape in the mail the other day because I assumed it was going to be the same story but after my first few puffs, while it wasn't fully as satisfying as a cigarette, it was close enough that I knew I could make the switch or at least cut down on tobacco. It's been 3 days smoke free (my longest gap without smoking was probably around 16 hours when I went into hospital once) and today was my first real test, the first cigarette I felt I had to have with my coffee on my drive to work, the one thing that gets me out of bed early. I passed the test pretty easily! A few puffs on the vape on the way to work and when I arrived and I was fine. I then stopped on the way home and vacuumed every spec of tobacco out of my car and did the same at home, also got rid of my tobacco as well.
 

I'm excited about the health benefits I'm going to experience too! I haven't even really thought about that. I can finally start being more active. The money saving aspect will be a bonus  as well.




I'm vaping 18mg nicotine out of cheap vaporizer with a tobacco flavor juice I don't even particularity like as well! I'm looking forward to upgrading this week and buying myself an assortment of flavors. I'll probably be looking at lowering my nicotine in time as well. I honestly have almost no idea about any of the technical aspects at this stage, all the jargon goes over my head. Ohm's, mods, atomizers, salts, etc. I know how to pour the liquid in the tank and press the button so that's good enough at this stage. Maybe I'll become a vape-bro-nerd in time, we'll see! It's does suck that the nicotine juice is illegal in Australia but it's easy enough to buy from New zealand and have delivered in a few days.


Anyway, I just felt ranting because I can't rant to others about quitting smoking, because no one knew I was a smoker in the first place!

t3_9qagsu,Can't screw coil shut Aspire Breeze 2,"Just bought a breeze 2 and can't screw the coil shut out of the box.

There is a small metal disc that connects to the battery (called the atomizer I think?) that is pushing the whole assembly up/stopping the threads from screwing closed. It sits at the bottom of the pod in like
some sort of o-ring.

t3_9qagro,Looking for a new mod/tank Recommendations,"Heres a little history.
I was squonking for a while with a GBOX and Dead Rabbit/Drop DNA on and off.  
I went on a road trip and purchased the Prince V12 tank with mesh coils so i'm not dripping and driving.  I got used to the convenience of having the Prince and buying coils instead of building them.  
My current mod is a Voopoo drag.  Getting a little bored of it and want to see what other people are using.
Recommendations on a new dual battery regulated mod, something that fits nice in the pocket and not really big.  Also a new tank that uses mesh coils.

What do you guys think?  Thanks in advanced for recommendations! ",Sun Oct 21 21:36:05 PDT 2018,MiZZie21
t3_9qacbp,Mi pod pod flavor hack!,"Hi guys , i recently received an updated pod but i still get a dull flavor therefore i modified the pod and i got extreme results!


What you need: 
-tweezers

- nail cutter or something to cut the excess wire with.

-flashlight

Steps:
1- Pull the golden pins carefully under the pod you will see the coil wires pointing out.

2- Shine the flash light on the side of the pod and you should see the coil clearly.

3- Use a thin needle to pierce the cotton to increase its surface area, the cotton in these pods are very tightly packed.

4- Then pull the wire using the tweezer, one by one and you should slowly see the coil moving downwards. Make sure the coil is centered between the two rubbers ( probably some  pods taste bad because of the coils touching the rubbers)

 4- Secure the golden pins and trim the excess wire.

Results: much better flavor and a very stronger hit. 

You’re welcome!

t3_9qa393,My local vape shop,"So this is kind of a frustration thread. I have gone to a local vape shop in Grand Rapids MI pretty much since ive started vaping. The shop is vape juice. When I first started to go there the staff was super awesome friendly and helpful. I ended up over the course of a year spent a lot of money at this place.

 The staff has become less and less friendly and helpful more from a family friend atmosphere to a big corporate atmosphere. 2 weeks ago I went in and tried to buy sale items they had listed on the website sales. Which they always honored if you came in and met resistance. I ended up having the sales person contact the owner Steven after several minutes of him arguing with me about not honoring online sales. Which he told him to honor it. Which sucks because to get him to contact Steven I had to threaten to take my business elsewhere. Ive never had to speak with my wallet ever to get good customer service at any business ever but had to and made them blink. This wasnt a new person either they knew me because im a super regular.

Ive spent thousands and I mean thousands of dollars at this business between juice hardware and accessories in less than a year. I feel bad for the way I was treated and went in their 2 days ago to buy some juice because imo they have the best juice lines but I almost felt unwelcomed it was super impresonable and I felt uncomfortable.

So I was wondering should I continue to do business with them or should I try to find another company to do business with.",Sun Oct 21 20:42:36 PDT 2018,Receptivexx

Got the Limitless v2 kit back in June, was really excited for it because I loved the original.

Cleaning the crap out of it, making sure the build was safe, checking for shorts, swapping out the spring (it came with 2 springs and both have this issue). It happens with 20700 and 18650 batteries.

And now, here are the new wraps:

NOTE: Dont mind the reverse wrap, it was the first one and I didnt notice I put it on the wrong sides lol. I know which side is which, dont worry!

Also, in the reverse wrap you can notice in the neg side the mod contact has pushed a little the neg contact on the bat, is still good to use?

Anyways, looking forward for your comments guys, wanna be sure before using them!

t3_9q661p,"Finally off dual-use, thanks to the helpful members of the community.","I started my vaping journey about a year ago, and went without analogues for about 2 and a half weeks before a particularly stressful work week, and ended up dual using. While I had cut back to about 3 cigs a day, I still wanted long term to quit the stinkies for good. 

I mostly lurk here, but have recommitted to focus solely on vaping within the past week and it has been going well so far, and I have thrown out the remainder of the carton I had hidden away in the garage. 

A lot of this is because of an abundance of users on this sub always being incredibly helpful when other members make a post, offering suggestions, giving opinions on gear, juice, etc. The openness of the community and their input has helped me land on a setup I feel satisfied with, and after a long, expensive juice exploration I've found brands and flavor profiles that make me crave them more than a cig, and haven't had the urge to tempt fate and ""just have one"" like I did when I first started.

So I just wanted to shout out some members of the community who's post I've always found particularly helpful, and reiterate to any members old or new that there are always people in this community who will go out of their way to help people find system that works for them.
****
/u/chucKing for always being so active and offering advice ranging from what shops are trustworthy, mods worth their salt, flavor lines, and just overall being a positive member of the sub.

/u/lestermagneto always seems to be helping people troubleshoot any issues they're having. and always voicing his opinion in a way that doesn't come across as elitist or downputting. (Shoutout for shilling the nunchaku, it's my new my favorite tank)

/u/vapeymcgyver For all of his tear down reviews, helping to put why certain mods have issues in a way that people can understand even without much knowledge on the subject, allowing for more informed purchases. 

/u/mooch315 for all things battery related, his tests have saved me from buying rewraps recommended by shops that are underperformers, as well as his constant knowledge of battery safety and working to help keep everyone vaping safely.

/u/Anthony_Vapes, /u/Foment_Life, and /u/pizzadave80 for all of their reviews, as well as Anthony's spreadsheet always being kept up to date with reliable hardware/vendors/etc.

/u/mstave for always linking articles that are relevant, and help draw attention to why vape advocacy is so important in this day and age.

My final shoutout is to /u/bottomofthemap, who has made a lifelong customer out of me with his great CS and amazing juices, ever since I've received my package from him I haven't had a single flavor that was anything less than great, and it has completely curbed my desire to dual use because I can't get enough of the flavor his juices pump out. Seriously, try Showtime if you haven't!

&nbsp;

There are of course countless others in the sub who are always helping out and deserve praise as well, but I don't want to make this anymore of a novel than it already is. The community know's who these people are, and I'm sure they are just as grateful to have them around as I am. As well as all of the vendors who stuck around during the reddit policy change and are active with sales, giveaways, etc.

&nbsp;

This turned out to be a bit longer than I expected, so I apologize for the wall of text. Thank you again for being such a great community, and for helping people lead a healthier lifestyle.

Smoant Charon Mini 225W - (Interesting colorful screen I like the background wallpaper changee function but I am worried it will scratch easily)

Innokin Proton 235W - (Joystick looks interesting)

Again I don't want to make my own coils as I don't want to mess anything up. I have an eLeaf iStick Power, and want to use this with the new RTA/RDA. If I bring this with me, its important that is it clean, and does not leak. Am I on the right track with what I am saying?  

&#x200B;

What would be a good choice for me, RDA, RTA or RDTA? What would be a good model to purchase, and what coils and cotton should I buy? I would like to stay on the cheaper side as well. Thank you in advance!",Sun Oct 21 08:35:59 PDT 2018,JohnyJames2

t3_9q2dih,"Noob questions: vaper's tongue, leaking, batteries blowing up/wattage.","Hello everyone, i am new on to vaping, i was a heavy smoker (2-3 packs of cigarettes per day), i smoked cigarettes since i was 14yo i am now 43 (stupid me) so i started vaping 2 weeks ago to quit the cigarettes (the walls of my room are supposed to be white but they are yellow), i was starting to feel pain on the chest, on my arms, on the lower part of my mandible (so yeah i got very scared). Now i have almost 1 month vaping (6mg nicotine liquids) and i was very happy, until i started reading about batteries exploding, i know media blows everything out of proportion, but i am now paranoid (very). Another thing that happened is that i got  “**Vaper's tongue**” , and wow! that thing is real :O, i can't taste any e-liquid, i even smoked 1 cigarette out of curiosity and i couldn't even taste the tobacco, it was like smoking air. But i will stick to the vape, i feel way better, no more pain on the chest, my fingers are not yellow anymore, and it is way cheaper (i hope to quit vaping too at some point).

&#x200B;

I have an Smok e-priv kit V12 (with a v12 prince RBA coil) is that vape safe? i vape at 65w with the resistance at 0.21ohms (they change the resistance at the store for 2$ i only need to change the cotton every week). I have seen some posts of Smok mods blowing up (the batteries) and omg every time i use the vape my heart starts pumping.

&#x200B;

Does that mod stops charging the battery once it is full? or do i need another charger? i am also using an usb 2.0 to charge the vape, is it safe?

The mod says it has: atomizer recognition, short circuit protection, over-heating protection, and 10 seconds cut off.

It does take a while to heat up so my inhales are like 4 secs long D:

&#x200B;

Another thing that scares me is that sometimes the tank starts leaking, can the liquid get in to the battery and cause a short?

&#x200B;

About vaper's tongue, well yeah it is a let down not being able to taste those awesome flavors, but i still get nicotine on to my body and it does calm me down.

&#x200B;

I wish i never saw those articles about vapes blowing up :(

t3_9q2aze,"Bench Test Results: Vapcell Green 28A 2000mAh 18650...accurately rated, consistent performer","Bottom Line: This cell is accurately rated and is a good performer. The VTC5A/5D/6A and Samsung 20S still hit harder though, especially the 20S which is still the hardest hitting 18650.

The cell-to-cell consistency of these Vapcells was very good, equal to cells from the major OEMs like Samsung, Sony, etc. They do not physically match any OEM cell I have though. I do not know where they were manufactured and Vapcell hasn’t responded to my question about that.

The four cells I tested delivered 2106mAh to 2128mAh at 400mA (0.2C) down to 2.5V. This is a very small range of values and is great to see.

I am ESTIMATING this Vapcell’s ratings to be 28A continuous (about 80W) and 2000mAh.

Four cells were donated for the purposes of testing by Vapcell (http://www.vapcelltech.com).

Ratings graphic: https://imgur.com/a/wewC2l3

I want to work for the vaping community full time! If you feel what I do is worth a couple dollars a month and you would like early access to battery availability and testing news and a say in what I test then please consider becoming a patron and supporting my testing efforts: https://www.patreon.com/batterymooch

These tests only note the ESTIMATED ratings for these batteries at the time I tested them. Any battery that is not a genuine Samsung, Sony, LG, Panasonic, or Sanyo can change at any time! This is one of the hazards of using “rewrapped” batteries or batteries from other manufacturers so carefully research any battery you are considering using before purchasing.

Misusing or mishandling lithium-ion batteries can pose a SERIOUS RISK of personal injury or property damage. They are not meant to be used outside of a protected battery pack. Never exceed the battery’s continuous current rating and keep the plastic wrap and top insulating ring in perfect condition.

Any rating in my ratings tables can change at any time as different grade cells appear on the market, we get swamped with fakes, or new information becomes available to me. Please, never assume that the ratings in the tables are permanent and will never change! Always download the latest version before considering any cell purchase.

t3_9q1an2,Smok Alien Faulty/Counterfeit Chip?,"I've had my Smok alien for 6 months now. The first 2 months, I used the Baby beast tank. After several drops, the screw in connector came loose and the solder cracked, causing the ""no coil"" error.

 I got it repaired at my local vape store, and when I collected it, they told me they had to replace a chip inside. I upgraded to the tf v12 prince tank, and straight away noticed that I wasn't getting hardly any vapour (I set the ohms and wattage correctly, as per the Coil). I switched back to my Baby beast and noticed the same thing with that. The virmware version had changed.

I returned to the store with my Vape and explained, but they just upped the wattage to like 100, still blew out tiny clouds, and told me that its just because the Alien is a cheap mod and they're all like that. 
I find it pointless arguing with clueless staff so I just got used to the vastly reduced vapour. One thing to note, Ive found it impossible to upgrade the software version on my device now. This makes me think that the chip they replaced was either faulty, or fake. 

I continued to use it for another month, and a friend of mine bought an alien of his own. However, he was blowing clouds 3-5 times bigger then I was with my prince tank set at 120W 0.12ohms, with his baby beast tank set at 50. I asked if I could test my tank on his mod... and low and behold, my tank started ripping clouds for days (I set the Ohms and wattage correctly according to each coil used, so that's not the problem. This is definitely a mod problem). My question is, how do i....

A. Convince the staff at the vape store that my vape does actually need repair, or....

B. Fix this shite myself.

Please please if anyone has experienced, and/or fixed an issue like this... Help me out, because I'm drawing a blank here. I don't fancy splashing out on a new mod when I know its just a repair job",Sat Oct 20 22:51:53 PDT 2018,TheSP90

Basically, I switched to TC after getting some SS claptons last week and I love not getting dry hits ever again, but now I'm confused as to when should I rewick. I used to do that when I was getting bad taste and dark cotton with kanthal, but now my cotton remains light while the coils gunk up and darken, somewhat muting the flavor. If I want to remain gunkless I'd have to dry burn and rewick pretty much everyday, is that a normal rate?

t3_9pzi2i,Dead Rabbit RDA No flavor? Help,"I have been using the Dead Rabbit RDA for about 6-7 months now. I love using it but it has really been a hit or miss for me. I will occasionally get a good build in there with good placement and great flavor, then I got to rebuild it later and its horrible.

&#x200B;

I was using a SS 316L dual simple round wire build ohming out at about .22 placed near the edges of the ""ears"" (posts) and was getting great flavor for months. Just the other day I tried to rebuild it as it was getting gunked up and I just felt like it to be honest.

I do the exact same build and get absolutely no flavor at all. Not discouraged, I take it out and run it back again. This time I moved the coils to be a little more center. This time, verrrrrrrrrrry little flavor that gets drowned out by other ""chemicals"" if you will. I am not sure how to explain the taste, but it isn't the juice.

&#x200B;

Little more discouraged, I search the internet for advice and tips and see what others have done and find topics that talk about moving the coils under the airflow (i.e. near the edges of the posts like this previous build) so I try this again annnnnnnnnnnd, nothing. I get so little flavor compared to what I have before..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have tried to raise the wattage from my normal 60 to about 70-80 to see if that helps and it does not, only brings out the nasty flavors of everything else. SO what should I try to do?

When building, I will lightly pulse the coils to get them glowing evenly (I make sure not to over burn) then I dry burn them a little bit and run under a small stream of water to knock off any chemicals and crap that may have gone on them while building. I clean up the water, make sure they still glow evenly and then wick. The wicking is slightly tight, but not enough that you can yank on it and it comes out freely. Slowly pulling will allow it to move, but a fast movement will pull the coil. 

&#x200B;

EDIT: After researching a bit, maybe my wick is a bit too tight. I will give this a shot as well. But feedback is still appreciated greatly.

t3_9pwg7i,Trouble with my new Berserker MTL RDA,"I have been really happy with my Zenith Tank running @13w (1.6ohm coil) and 6mg freebase. I use the first two airholes and flavor/vapor production is just great. I am pretty new to vaping, but I would prefer to keep it MTL (out of habit, and to keep things frugal).

I decided to try an RDA so that i could experiment more with new liquids - and just for something new to play with. The Berserker seemed pretty well reviewed, and available local - so I picked one a couple days ago. Unfortunately, I just can't seems to get it where I want it. My Zenith is just so much better. It is my only point of reference, but I was hoping to set the Berserker up for a similar experience.

It has the stock coil (Superfine MTL FusedClapton Coil 30ga*2+38ga ID:2.5 0.7ohm Ni80 6Wraps) and Cotton Bacon Prime - same fluid and running @20w. I have raised and lowered the wattage a bit and it either gets too hot (popping) or it just doesn't have much output. I have swapped different airflow tubes and use different setting son the outer barrel. The flavor isn't really there and when I get a decent amount of vapor (by tuning airflow and/or drawing more slowly) it is way more harsh.

I know there is a lot of variables in this situation - I was just hoping maybe I could find some tips/insight. Is it even possible to get a similar experience to the Zenith Tank (maybe it's just that good) ?

Any help you find people could give would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

t3_9pwc8b,"I failed, I had quit smoking for so long but I had a fall back","Hi there,

So in August of 2017 I bought my first E-cig, not because I planned to buy one, but because the store I always bought my cigarettes sold them, so I thought I'd give it a try, but it took me a few months to actually stop smoking cigarettes all together, mainly because my Ex girlfriend smoked, and whenever she went for a smoke I joined in, but in December we broke up, and I quit smoking.

All went well, I was vaping on my RDA, and I used about 60 ML a week, and spend about £20 a week on it. but then I somehow lost my coil cutter ( is that how you call them? I don't know ), and I had to buy a new one, and money is tight on my end so I simply couldn't afford it. and so... about 9 months after my last cigarette I bought another pack today....

&#x200B;

Now I would love to tell you that they are absolutely disgusting tasting, and I want to get back to vaping as soon as I can, but that's not the story here, it doesn't taste as bad as I thought they would. 

&#x200B;

But alas, I am going to save up money, buy the tools so I can cut my coils again, and get back to only vaping. hopefully it'll be easier to fully quit in one time now. I hope sooner rather than later! 

I thought I'd share my fail story, in the hopes of creating a success story soon too! ",Sat Oct 20 11:12:40 PDT 2018,Rebeux

t3_9pw6zj,"Help With Jumping Resistance and Temp Protection (DNA250C, Innokin Ares, 30g SS316L Coil)","Okay so! I got an Innokin Ares recently and I'm finally trying out MTL vaping. I'm planning a ""review"" of the tank which is actually going to be more like a write-up of my experience with MTL vaping since this is my first time really trying it.

I am enjoying it, but I'm noticing a bit of an issue that's bothering me. Seen in my flair, I have a DNA 250C device. I'm using a single 30g SS316L coil that's wrapped about 11 times (counting the legs) with a 2.5mm inner diameter. The resistance it comes out to apparently is ranging from 1.28 ohms to 1.43 ohms.

Now I've read before that this is not considered a major jump and is perfectly normally, especially for such thinner-gauge wire. The problem is that I'm using temp control with it and I keep hitting temp protection.

For the record, I'm currently vaping at 10 watts and 460 degrees F. I know temp protection usually means the coil's dry, so I took out the deck and thinned out the cotton. My cotton is in there tight, but also, because it's 30 gauge wire, I didn't want it too tight because I didn't want to deform the coil trying to put it in. It's wicking nicely (I think? I Hope?), but I'm *still* hitting temp protection, and I can only get out of it by re-reading the resistance of the coil, which is where it will jump.

So doing the read right now 5 times in a row, starting with the current read of 1.3502 ohms, I get 1.3055, 1.3175, 1.3100, 1.3216, and 1.3035 ohms. Now that's actually on the smaller end of jumping, but last night it actually jumped from 1.2813 to 1.4302 ohms in one read after hitting temp protection. And just now, it went from 1.3035 to 1.4299, again after hitting temp protection...

I mean I realize it could still be my wicking, but I think my wicking's okay...? Here's an album of pics I just took a moment ago to show the wicking...

https://imgur.com/a/rshvLlC

BTW... just did another read, and it went from 1.4299 down to 1.3096 ohms. Again, I realize that these are probably not actually wild jumps, but I don't know why else I'd be hitting temp protection when it seems to be wicking fine...?",Sat Oct 20 10:56:39 PDT 2018,NateHevens

t3_9pvhwi,Looking for a new device,"Hey guys, I'm looking for a new vaping device and need your help.

Last week, my SMOK AL85 kit stopped working properly. The tank had already been leaking a lot for the last few months and now the fire button doesn't work reliably anymore either. Though I'm not really new to vaping, I don't have too much technical know-how about it tbh. I don't want to repeat the mistake of buying something that doesn't fit my vaping habits. That's also why I want to stick to devices that are ready out of the box (no RBAs etc.).

I only vape juice that contains 70%-87% VG and I typically vape at lower wattages, somewhere between 25 and 50.

In the past, I had problems with lots of tanks because they weren't suited for my high VG juices, so I need something that can handle those.

In addition, I hate it when tanks leak because I always carry my device in my trouser's pocket.

Furthermore, I was mainly using 18650 batteries up until now. If possible, I'd love to use batteries that last longer since I sometimes carry my vape around with me for 16+ hours without the possibility of charging.

I already asked around in retail stores as well as on forums. The Uwell Nunchaku was what was suggested the most, though I gotta say that I'm not too fond of its box mod (because of the shape). Meaning that if the Nunchaku would indeed be a good choice, I'd need a suggestion for a box mod that works fine with it.",Sat Oct 20 09:30:10 PDT 2018,ApoNow6

I want to go diy cheaper still.. live on a tight budget due to being on disability benefit.. I need to find good, cheap suppliers for quality concentrated eliquid that is specifically for adding to the 70/30 base.. finding  500ml or 1L bottles of 70/30 base would be nice also but I suspect that delivery cost might make the product more expensive than buying it where I live.. can get the 70/30 base here for between €8.90/€10.90 per 1L not including delivery, but the juice concentrate flavours that you add to the base here costs as much per month as buying ready made from fasttech.. that’s about €6 per 10ml.. you apparently need to add 15% concentrate to base liquid so for 1L that’s 150ml of concentrate.. €90 is to much for me.

&#x200B;

So a little backstory (tl;dr).  I first had a wismec rx300.  I enjoyed this mod, but eventually the battery latch wore down to the point where it wouldn't close and make a connection.  My next mod was the SMOK XPriv.  This thing... don't get me started.  I had it for a week before I put one battery in upsidedown and it started firing by itself, melting & deforming one of two of the positive battery connections.  The shop I bought it from was nice enough to replace it.  Three weeks later, my chair hits my table, table shakes my vape off onto the ground.  The magnetic battery compartment flew off, with a battery about halfway out FULL FIRING on the f\*\*king carpet.  There goes another Xpriv.  Why do those self fire so easily?????!?  SO dangerous

&#x200B;

Basically I am looking for a relatively cheap mod (40-70$) that goes up to 150w at a minimum, 2 battery with BATTERY SAFETY!!!!  I am mostly in the market for a mod that has a latch that won't wear down, or fire by itself and destroy itself due to one small user error.

&#x200B;

At this point I will reject no brand.  I had already tried what I (thought?) to be the most respectable brand, SMOK, and one error I caused could have been bad.

t3_9ps2cf,"Just asking for some DTL RDA suggestions, having trouble finding ""what I'm looking for"" in this case. Thanks in advance!","So I currently use Mutation V3, very happy with it. However, I'd like to move up to a 24 or 25mm RDA for increased juice well. I'd also like it pretty deep. I want to be able to use a lot more cotton, like maybe nearly double what I use in the Mutation V3. I'd also like it to be sleeved/barreled in such the way similar to the Mutation, but preferably not the diagonal cutouts on the cap, a different airflow, but from the same place, so I can saturate until it would leak in other setups. IE, no bottom flow air. Side of the coils only, or maybe side and optional top air if you have a suggestion for that.

I'd like a different deck than the velocity style Mutation V3 has, but it's not a must. When I bought the V3, a guy in the store had one that, I think was single-post, he had like, an amazing build in there. He said I made a good choice, especially being newer at the time, however he said with his he can build all the interesting and cool builds, (I think he made a chimney, or maybe he called it a dragon coil, it was 2+ years ago) or he can use regular microcoils, too. So, that's not an important thing, but if anyone knows what I'm talking about there, fun builds are something I want to get into (for the fun of it, more than the utility, but his build was awesome it shot vapor straight up out of the cap).

Recap (that is longer than the start because of more info, oops):

Looking for deep well, lots of room for cotton/juice. Not really going to spill unless I try to spill it or knock it over. 24 or 25mm. Preferably not ""another"" velocity style deck (my griffin, my gemini, my mutation, all of them are velocity, want something new, but not something corny. something friendly to weirdo fun builds).

Oh, and it ought to not have a bunch of structure in the well. I like a big open space, like the mutation, sans its huge velocity obstruction in the center. NOT like the Mutation V4, for example, which wants me to tuck cotton into a space so that it has bottom air flow: No bottom airflow, side is my favorite. I've tried a bunch of RDA's on other people's mods, on vape store tasters and such, I just really am pleased with side air.

Bonus: Black and White stormtrooper look is a massive plus. So is wismec/tiffany blue (teal/turquoise?). Black is okay, too (matte!). I'm OCD about matching, currently my mods are stormtrooper colored and black/teal.

I'm okay with Ultem details and tips. Just not ""all gold and ultem"", keeping in line with my matching.

Thanks for any suggestions to look over! I'm not going to jump right away, I just appreciate any suggestions to help me get right to some reviews, rather than sifting through endless bottom-air or velocity-style decks never finding what I'm looking for lately. Thanks again!",Sat Oct 20 00:07:58 PDT 2018,[deleted]

t3_9prkyo,Smoant Screen Question,"I recently purchased a Vaporesso Luxe, and am very unimpressed with the material that they used to build the screen/faceplate and the battery cover on the back.  It is an extremely delicate plastic that scratches easier than a damn CD (if you remember what those are).  Like I have been extremely careful with it, and it is so incredibly easy to scuff.  It's really pretty ridiculous.  It's as if they think people will never leave their couch with this thing.  I'd say you need to bubble wrap it, but truthfully, that would likely scratch it as well.  It's honestly quite pathetic, and it's too bad, because everything else about the mod is pretty great.  There is a reason that the modern industry standard for screens now calls for glass.  Apparently Vaporesso missed that memo.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone can tell me what type of material is used on the Smoant Naboo and the Charon Mini.  I have looked all over for this information, but can't find anything regarding what they're made  out of.  I want to make sure it's not made with the same crappy plastic before I make a decision.

t3_9prgwj,Newbie Question about Pen length of life,Hi all.  I just started vaping last week.  I got a pen with a cbd oil cartridge for my anxiety. It works great!  But now I'm wondering how long this pen is gonna last.  I'm looking into ordering more cartridges but should I get a new pen as well?  Everything Google brought up was for the big things with tanks and how to change the coils on that.  But I like having a pen.  Can you change coils on pens?  I'm totally lost on this stuff and any help would be great.,Fri Oct 19 22:20:01 PDT 2018,PornCommentsAreWeird
t3_9prg21,PIZZA DAVE DELIVERS - A MOD REVIEW - THE SAILBOAT BY THINKVAPE,"  

Hello everyone, Pizza Dave here, delivering you a review of the Sailboat by Thinkvape. The Sailboat is a single 18650 regulated mod, recently released by Think Vape. This interesting device has a max wattage of 85w, has temp control settings (that don’t work), and it has an interesting design. Let’s dive down and look at the device, how it vapes, and as always, I will give my final thoughts down at the bottom.

DISCLAIMER: This device was sent to me by [BuyBest](https://www.buybest.com/product/85W-Think-Vape-Sailboat-Baby-Mod_62174.html) for review.

**WHAT YOU GET**

* 1 Thinkvape Sailboat 85w mod
* 1 USB cable
* 1 Manual

  

Available in Black, White, Red, Rainbow, Green, and Purple.

**FEATURES**

Like I said in the intro, the Thinkvape Sailboat is an 85w mod that is powered by a single 18650. It has an upgraded version of the Thor board within (says THOR on bootup), and in all honesty there are no other features to really discuss. It is curvy, shaved oddly, and the fire button is hidden at the top portion of the display.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**OPERATION**

This device is very straight forward. It will power up once batteries are inserted, and it cannot be powered down. Clicking the fire button 5 times will lock the device. With 3 clicks of the fire button you can cycle through the modes.

Bypass

TC NI200

TC Titanium

TC Stainless Steel

Available in Black, White, Red, Rainbow, Green, and Purple.

When in a TC mod, hold the up and down buttons to set the preheat wattage. There are no other features to really care about.

&#x200B;

**HOW IT VAPES**

I ran this device with smaller tanks for the most part, and in wattage mode as I felt this is where it was going to best suited. What I found is that it “feels” a bit overstated on wattage and I had to bump the wattage up a bit higher on this than I would with other mods I have. Another thing to take not of is that once you start running it at 65 watts and up, the battery life drops at a fast pace due to the fact that it is just a single 18650 device. I would have much rather seen this device be a hair wider and thinned out internally to house a 21700. It would have made it much more appealing and gave it a bit of a bump in performance. I attempted to run TC for a stainless-steel build, but I couldn’t get it to do a damn thing. It detected the coil, temp was set to 430 degrees, and preheat was set to 70w. It didn’t heat up much at all and produced very little vapor. Even when cranked to 600 degrees it hardly fizzled. I think it is safe to say TC isn’t an option with this, or I got a dud. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

The Sailboat mimics a few different devices already on the market. It is small and curvy and is quite comfortable to hold. The fire button is universal and can be thumb fired, finger fired, or fully on gripping it will fire as well. I have no gripes with the shape as it becomes second nature in no time. The whole thing feels constructed quite well also. However, it is FULL of cons. The single 18650 is a con as it didn’t get me through a full work day at all and it seems like it isn’t far off from being able to be a 21700 device. The screen is another con. It is VERY dark, and nearly impossible to read outdoors. Another con is the lack of TC. Lastly, the base is small, and it is a tipping hazard. It tipped it over like 5 times, and I never tip anything over. I do not recommend this for people who vape over 50w as it diminishes the battery very fast and it has the other cons listed. HOWEVER, I am seeing these for a super low price right now of $27.15 on BuyBest. For that price, I think this mod is a decent one for people that like to run low wattage MTL atomizers. I can see this being a daily banger with something like a Zenith on it for sure. It just doesn’t work well when pushed to the limits.

&#x200B;

**THE OVEN TEST**

If this device went into the oven, would I go out and get another one? Nope, nope, and nope.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**PROS**

* Comfortable in hand
* Fits 25mm atomizers
* Looks alright
* Pocket friendly

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**CONS**

* TC doesn’t work
* Narrow base is tippy
* Only a single 18650 (who does that these days?)
* Screen is too dark
* Lack of setup options

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank you all for reading this review and thank you to [BuyBest](https://www.buybest.com/product/85W-Think-Vape-Sailboat-Baby-Mod_62174.html) for sending it my way for review. If you want to pick one up, BuyBest has them listed for just $27.15. That is a crazy cheap price.

In here, Muji or Ko Gen Do ones are the most famous ones because of Muji can be bought around $2 and not hard to find the official Muji store while latter suddenly became famous product because ""it's used for vaping internationally"". There's also a product named ""Kendo cotton"" which widely used by Japanese Youtubers. But clé de peau BEAUTÉ by Shiseido (Yes it's a Japanese cotton regardless of it's name) is considered as ""best of best cotton in Japan"" too.

t3_9pr9tv,Quick question about wicks,"Hey guys. So I got a VandyVape Pulse 24 on a VT Inbox squonk mod. I’m using a single premade clapton coil at 55w. Coil reads .22ohm

I’ve noticed that on occasion when I go to change my cotton, the wick has completely been separated. It’s like the center of the wick that’s in the coil disappeared leaving only the ends that poke out the side of the coil and sit in the juice wells. Now I would normally think I’m accidentally burning it in two, but the cotton is always white, even on the ends where the middle “burnt” out. And I never take dry hits on it, at least not to the point where the whole middle of the wick would burn away. 

Any idea what’s happening? ",Fri Oct 19 21:46:25 PDT 2018,ProdigyLightshow

I've cleaned the 510 connection & threading multiple times. I've used the same attys on my VP Alpha One with zero issues. Never been abused, dropped or exposed to any leaks.

I'm wondering if this could be a saftey concern or just an annoyance?

Do not do that. It just tastes like burnt ass. Even though the wick was fine, I guess the burn flavor gets down under the surface into the juice. It was gnarsty, I had to rewick right away. Ended up wasting in the end, because I added to it after squeezing it out onto the new wicks.

t3_9pnnlb,Starting vaping as a non-smoker?,"So, I'm thinking about starting *nicotine free* vaping.

My reasons are mainly:

1) The social aspect of vaping.
Alot of my friends vape, and I like the idea of sitting somewhere with your friends and vaping together, talking about various topics. 

2) The overall feel and process of vaping.
The relaxation of the process. 
Just sitting back, inhaling the smoke and watching it fly through the air as you exhale it. (maybe doing some tricks while at it)

3) The hobby side of it.
Trying various flavors or making your own, building your own mod, trying different techniques or learning tricks with the smoke.
I can imagine I'd like that.

Now I haven't even tried a vape yet, even though my friends offered me to taste.
Mind this, I'm only talking about *nicotine free* vaping, as I'd like to completely avoid nicotine if I'd start. 

My questions are:

1) How unhealthy or addictive is *nicotine free* vaping? Are there any risks I should be aware of? 

2) Will I be able to stay nicotine free, won't I get tempted to try eliquids with nicotine? (maybe your personal experience?)

3) Do you think that it's worth starting for me, considering my reasons?

Also, before I actually make the decision, I want to taste it to see if I'd actually like it. That's kind of important before thinking about it.
(Also sorry if I used wrong terms, I'm completely new to this)

All of this is just me speculating and asking questions before deciding, I really want to be sure that I'm not doing a wrong decision if I decide to go for it. ",Fri Oct 19 13:31:21 PDT 2018,mnpj22

t3_9plz93,"Foment [review] - a Lego brick with a giant screen, the Hugo Ranger!","What's up today folks? Today I'm looking at a dual battery mod that has probably flown under the radar for most of us. The [Hugo Ranger](https://www.hugovapor.com/product/hugo-vapor-ranger-gt234/). The device was sent to me by [Hugo Vapor](https://www.hugovapor.com/) for the purposes of this review. There are an ungodly number of dual 18650 mods out there now so what separates this one from the pack? Let's discuss!

#Mod Aesthetics
----------------------------------------

The mod is, well unique. It's sort of the middle ground between a giant lego brick and a portable cassette deck. It neither looks like it will be comfortable in your hand, nor that ergonomics were a concern of merit in the design. This much is a massive departure from their purely comfort focused design of their [Orbiter](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/9h7n1b/foment_review_the_90s_made_a_mod_the_hugo_orbiter/). The mod isn't exactly light either, the entire body being zinc alloy does make it a bit chunkier, though a fair bit lighter than some older heavyweights like the OG Cuboid. The real star of the show here is the display. It certainly is the star of the show as well, being a massive 2"" display on a non touch device leaves little room for controls, which aren't exactly crammed into the face of the device but there certainly isn't a ton of wasted space here either. The display happily couples a very clear, if unexciting, readout with the sheer size of it. The display colors can be customized right along with the LED lights on either side of the screen. The LEDs are an interesting touch as they really don't add anything to me, but being that they can be disabled they also don't really retract from the overall design either. The display also will fall idle to one of three selectable screen options. The nicest looking of the 3 is, in my view, the analog clock. That however is a bit of a nuisance as the clock and date will be reset any time the batteries are out of the mod for more than a minute or so. Having a means of storing the date and time while the device isn't being powered would have been nice to see. The menu is accessed by triple clicking the 'M' button on the device face and navigated intuitively enough. One thing that I find to be a bit of a bother is that the display for the two batteries frequently shows them at about an 8 to 10% difference in charge, though by going into the menu the voltages are displayed along with board temperature and the voltage has never read more than 0.1v apart in my use (which makes sense with married cells). On one hand, hooray something other than a generic battery bar or bars, on the other hand the consistently disparate percentages being displayed is an annoyance. The battery door is another true nicety to me, the door is essentially the whole back of the device, and the standard battery safety sheet we've all seen in a device box is stuck right to the inside of the door. There's no getting away from it, and it's a really nice touch. One thing I would have liked to see is the removal of the slightly raised platform where the 510 resides. The 510 itself appears rather robust, but the platform reduces the maximum size of an atomizer that will sit flush from a comfortable 30mm down to 26. It's not a major issue, but it is a situation where *not* doing something would have been preferable to actually doing that thing. The mod is a unique design for sure, and despite looking as though it was designed from the screen backwards it's surprisingly comfortable to hold with the mod sitting in your palm your thumb should sit comfortably right across the fire button making it a very natural device to fire.

#Mod Performance
-----------------------------------------

After all the hemming and hawing about how a mod looks and feels in the hand, none of it means a thing if it doesn't work, right? With that in mind, power mode has been *fine*, not terrifically fast, doesn't feel as though it fires high, might be a bit low but not grossly so under 100w. That much is all good enough news, right? The preheats seem to work as you'd expect, soft, standard, hard, all pretty normal stuff. As /u/Anthony_vapes has indicated his device does seem to cut out occasionally around 4-5 seconds draw time, I have not been able to reproduce that behavior myself, and that could speak to the quality control on the devices or it could speak to a fluke occurrence with his mod. Temp control has however been an adventure. I've yet to nail down a consistent way to get the device to perform adequately in temp control. With sets of stainless dual fused claptons that were more than comfortable on the Orbiter in TC the Ranger only succeeds in preventing me from burning my cotton. With the power around 20 watts above where I'd fire the same atomizer in power mode, the TC vape is remarkably weak. with the appropriate TCR of .00092 the vapor production is truly meager. with the stock .00100 TCR and the temperature set into the low to mid 500F range it feels at best like I'm sitting around 420F. It's trying very hard to work in TC, but it's missing the mark by a fair margin. I'd love to see that improved going forward. Hugo has shown us that it's able to make TC work, but has missed the mark there quite heartily in this case.

**Pros:**   
* Great display   
* Durable body   
* Battery warning graphic on the door is a nice touch   
* Surprisingly comfortable in use

**Cons:**   
* TC is non-functional  
* System clock is not persistent   
* LED Lights cannot be set to illuminate only when firing. On with the screen or off all the time   
* Inaccurate battery level display

#Final Thoughts
---------------------------------------

At the end of the day, This isn't a mod you buy because of the performance. It's pretty much right in the middle of the pack in that capacity. You'd be looking to buy this for the design or for the screen. If you want a huge crisp display, this will meet or exceed your expectations in that sense. No nonsense giant letters and numbers showing everything you'd need to know. The device body is, particularly in the black version, a rather industrial affair and if that design appeals to you, you could probably do a fair bit worse. I wouldn't recommend it for performance though. It's a form over function affair all the way with this mod. It works well enough for most folks to be satisfied with it, so long as the design is to their liking, but not so well as to make you overlook any of its faults.

t3_9pluk8,Anybody make the switch from a high powered mod to a Juul or some other nic salt setup?,"I replaced my pack a day habit with vaping about 4 years ago. I've gradually upgraded my setup over the years and now I'm using a switcher with a valyrian tank. I vape 3mg and I go through a TON of juice, like 20ml a day. Back when I was using ancient equipment like an ego-c twist with a kanger T2 I would go through about 2ml a day. It was 12-18mg, but even since I've dropped to 3mg my usage has increased with every upgrade. It's getting fairly expensive and I'm a little concerned that vaping that much is probably not so healthy. I haven't tried a nic salt setup, but I've heard it's more satisfying. I'm wondering if anyone that vaped like me has switched and do you find you can vape a lot less and feel satisfied, or did you still vape a lot out of habit and make yourself sick? I'm not sure if I vape so much because I'm more addicted to nicotine than I was before, or if it's just because I enjoy it so much. I might quit all together, it wouldn't be easy but it would save me a lot of money. ",Fri Oct 19 10:14:05 PDT 2018,trp1784

##Initial Impressions and features

When I first got this Mod, I was pretty impressed with the design. It’s the type of design that’s right up my alley and reminded me of the sx mini g class but with less flair to it. It’s a simple symmetrical design small mod with a front facing color screen and can handle a 30mm atomizer without overhang. It’s like a slightly bigger modefined lyra to accommodate 30mm atomizers and i love mods designed like that. Overall pretty happy with it from the start.


##Watt Mode Performance (chart and spreadsheet in picture album)

Now let’s get into some data. I ran my normal testing. I used Sony VTC5A batteries for the testing. Testing resistances were done at .12, .14, .19, and .63 ohms. wattage points were max (235), 200, 150, 100, 75, 50 and 25. At .12 ohms it maxed out at 178 watts and 39 amps.  For the rest of the testing it was on the low side 11-17 watts at 100+ but only 1-8 watts under 100 watts. Pretty typical struggle at that resistance and on par with most.  At .14 it maxed out at 248 watts. The rest were pretty good 1-3 watts high except at 200 when it was 14 watts high and 50 when it was 1 watt low. For the .2 test it maxed out at 210 watts. Again really good but a little on the high side this time 1-7 watts mostly. For the .63 testing it maxed out at 89 watts and 7.469 volts. For the rest of the testing a little high 1-4 watts which is common. The volts shows there is no boost circuit in this mod like most dual battery mods have.


Overall I felt the performance of this mod was really good. It struggled a little with the .12  ohm build which is common for most mods at that resistance to struggle a bit. It mostly hits slightly high above the .12 ohms though pretty accurate mod on par with many of the best ones. I was able to get 248 watts max, so I consider it to be accurately rated actually a bit underrated at 235 watts. They could have called it 250 watts and i would have considered that accurate. The 7.469 volt limit shows there is no boost circuit. Their manual lists the max Volts at 8.V so it’s plausible it can do that with a higher ohm coil, no complaints there. At least they didn’t list the voltage at 8.4 like some companies do. They list an amp limit on this mod of 36A. The most i got was 39 with a .12 ohm coil which is average for a dual battery mod (average is around 40 these days) and exceeds the listed amount so well done there as well.  Personally If i was listing the specs I’d call the mod 250 watts, 8V and 40A. So overall great listed specs that are accurate. The mod never got warm when stressing it at all or had a temp protect kick in, however the metal top plate does take on heat from the atomizer.  The mod has a watt curve which works well however, the mod also has a small hard preheat on normal which i’m not a fan of. Not a big deal but wish companies didn’t do this as we have a hard preheat option for a reason so no need to add it into the normal preheat either. I will ding them for that.


## Simplified TLDR Power Performance summary

Mod performance is good. Mostly hits just a few watts off on the high side at above .12 ohms but struggles a little at .12 which is normal. Underrated for watts (248), No boost circuit, average amp limit of 39 but exceeds the 36A listed. Volts tested at 7.469 so a less than the 8V listed but plausible with a higher ohm coil. Watt curve works as it should, has a hard preheat on normal however.

##Temperature Control Performance 

Using SS316 wire in SS mode (note there is no TCR mode or TCR adjustments),  I tested 8 builds. 2 simple round single coil, 2 simple round dual Coil, 2 large fancy single coils builds, and 2 large fancy dual coil builds. The mod has full adjustable watts as well to adjust ramp up and works great. With that said I was surprisingly impressed with this mod. The aurora mod their last one I tested wasn’t good at TC at all, so I wasn’t expecting much, but the wildwolf performed really well. It’s good for a warm vape around the 460-500F range so it does hit a little on the weak side. Maybe like 30-50F weaker then it should, but outside of that no complaints. It was consistent, good smooth throttle, the wattage setting adjusts ramp up, no dry hits. Everything I look for in a TC mod passes. Just as good as your typical aspire, innokin, vaporesso, smoant, etc mod so pretty impressed there. Just note due to no TCR adjustments (which i’ll ding them for) using SS430 or nife or other wires may not be feasible. I’d stick to SS316 only on this mod. It does have Ti and Ni200 mode as well but i’m not a fan of those wire types. Overall a very good performing mod in TC at the price point.


 

## Other Usage Notes

The mod uses a standard 5 click to lock the mod. There is no off button, however the mod automatically turns off after sitting idle for around 60 mins. The menu system is really easy to use and well done. There is a menu button and it works similar to the DNA250c chip. You press menu, then you use plus or minus to highlight what you want to adjust then press menu so you can adjust it. For modes you have temp, volts, and watts. Each mode has sub modes. For watts it’s soft preheat, normal preheat, powerful preheat, and watt curve mode. For volts there is no sub mode. For Temp it’s it’s Ni, Ti, SS, Ni curve, Ti curve, and SS curve. You can also highlight the temp type to change from F to C (Fahrenheit to Celsius) and highlight the watts to adjust them. Very nicely done and easy to use. 


The Hcigar Wildwolf 235 adjusts by .1 watt increments under 100 watts and full watt increments 100 or more. Holding the button down does full watt as well and it adjusts nicely and is easy to do so well done there. The mod itself is built solid with no rattle at all, and is pretty lightweight. The Battery door is a standard Bottom Latch and  It’s easy to get batteries in and out without damaging wraps and takes 2 18650 batteries. Nothing we haven’t seen before but works great and nicely done.


The top and bottom plates of the mod are zinc alloy like most mods however the body section itself is made from PC (polycarbonate) which gives it a little bit of a softer feel and that feels nice and lowers the weight yet still feels sturdy. I have the red one and the color looks great and is actually red and not pink like some other “red” mods i’ve seen. The fire button is nice and clicky and a good size. It is an oval shaped button above the screen. It works well and It never gets stuck or anything though which is as it should be and is really comfy to use. The 510 pin gave me no issues and every atomizer i used on it worked great with no gaps. It’s also very nicely done secured with 2 screws on the outside and nice grounding and soldering and good thick load wire. It does get hot during stress testing taking on heat from the atomizer though which is normal but the mod itself being PC on the body doesn't get hot. The mod handles a 30mm atomizer flush which is great. The 510 is on a 30mm platform. I love a small mod that can accommodate that. It also comes with a beauty ring for 22mm atomizers but looks funky. It looks much better without the beauty ring. They should have made it for 25mm atomizers if they wanted to include one, but i’m not going to complain about extras. They also include a silicon case for the mod as well which is nice. You need to remove it to change batteries and i didn’t care to use it personally but it’s a nice bonus to include. The screen is a great size .96 inch square color screen that is nice and bright and easy to see. Also for branding the mod itself it just has a Hcigar logo on the back. They list 1.6A charging as well but i don’t recommend charging internally in your mods and I don’t test charge rates of devices like this due to that.




##Pros:


* 5 color options 
* Power mode performance
* Underrated for watts
* good amp limit (39) that exceeds the listed rating
* good volt limit for a mod without a boost circuit
* batteries are easy to get in and out without damaging wraps
* great size bright color screen
* nice fire button
* handles 30mm atomizers without overhang
* watt curve mode
* great menu system
* easy to adjust wattage quickly
* lightweight
* very comfy to use
* some included extras (beauty ring and silicone case)
* TC performance
* Build Quality
* nice paint job





##Cons:
 

* no TCR adjustments or mode
* no way to turn off manually (automatically turns off after non usage)
* normal preheat functions like hard preheat






##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this mod or not? I don’t like to do a hard yes or no but this will lean pretty heavily towards the yes. It’s another one of those “budget g class” style mods like the cylon and lyra and is sized between the 2. It’s slightly bigger than a lyra, just enough bigger to handle a 30mm atomizer without overhang, but smaller than a cylon. One of the smallest mods that can take a 30mm atomizer for sure. My only big complaint is lack of TCR adjustments but outside of that you have an affordable well built mod that works great for power and TC mode and can handle a 30mm atomizer. I added this mod to my sheet of recs linked down below.


This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

Anyhow I’m starting to ramble so I will get to the point .

What is the best way to clean your droppers,bottles, well containers I suppose as it covers any/all things you use to store your supply of juice . 

I have numerous little 30ml bottles and same 100ml and 250ml ones 

I have a large 50ml syringe I use to measure my flavours/nicotine to get the right percentage mix I’m sure you get what I’m failing to explain to you 😂 .

It’s not really the larger bottles as I have enough to keep them to use for same each time it’s just the droppers and syringe as I’ve not come across anything better to do what I want for the mix . 

As you guys know there some concentrates that just overpower things and can still be tasted 2/3 mixes later . 
Like dragon fruit , aniseed ,orange and you get the picture I’m sure . 

Hot water with the wife’s washing up liquid from the kitchen is my current way but it still leaves after taste for a good while and I think there must be a better way . 

What do you good people use for your own laboratory cleanup ? 
Have you managed to stumble upon the perfect solution?

t3_9pl3fs,Vaporesso Switcher no longer auto-detects tank wattage,"Hi All,

&#x200B;

I've had a Vaporesso Switcher for about 3 weeks now and it's been a great mod.  That said, after the first week or so it stopped auto-detecting the wattage of the tanks I put on it.  It did this very reliably for a while.  Then it just.....stopped doing it.  I've reset the mod to defaults and still not dice.

t3_9pkrds,Citadel RDA - coil position and first impression,"Hey guys,

So I decided to finally venture into higher end stuff so today i got my first one - Citadel RDA. Tbh i wanted to try Hadalay but it was impossible to get it here.. and I really didn’t want to go with clone.

So without thinking a lot, i put a coil inside - simple n80 fused clapton. I had a bit of issues with space cos i forgot how to build on 22mm. So my first build had a short cos i didn’t cut the legs enough but after fixing that, i was ready to go.

My first impression is that flavor is really great..with that kind of coil, i was not able to get this amount of dense and flavorful vape on other single coil atties. I really liked Recurve but it was immediately clear that this is another league.

I was wondering if someone else has Citadel and if you can tell me how do you position your coil - height wise? I put my a bit below the top post but maybe thought of trying my next build a bit lower.
Current one:
https://imgur.com/a/km6n4OB

Also, what kind of coil build would be the best for this thing? 

Thanks!

Ps. This is not a review but just few points from my side..the build quality, machining and general feel is definitely top class. Can’t compare with anything i have from other mainstream brands. Amazing.
Flavor is really great and i fell in love with the airflow.. fits perfectly for my style of vaping..
My only complaint would be a drip tip - a bit too short so it can get hot out there. Also, apart from orings and extra screws, there are nothing else in the package. For this level of product and its price point, i expected at least one additional drip tip.. but it’s not a real con - just me being a bit spoiled :)",Fri Oct 19 08:16:42 PDT 2018,zla_smrt

I need help tho,"So I have been on pod systems and have enjoyed them since about right before juul got stupid popular.  I have a gx350 with a cigpet eco 12 and then got a revenger kit.  The revenger was hella amazing, but unfortunately it got stolen and that's when I said fuck it and went to pure pod system use.  I had a mipod after saying fuck it to them damn juul prices as well as an infinix.  But nothing compared to the way a juul hit(I love throat hit with pod systems).

But now im back to the juul and just need to get off these and I want my flavor back I miss it.  SO! I ask you guys where should I start?  What mods have come out that are great, I will say I like flavor the most, and clouds, tho most devices chuck nowadays.  I also like to fiddle sometimes, not really wanting to get into rebuilding but fiddling with settings is fun.  So basically I want a mod with decent power (preferable dual 18650) and a tank that has great flavor(Still not looking to go rda even tho it's said they have the best flavor) Also I do like a good looking mod, saw the Vsticking vk530 with a yihi in it and it looks cool with the power I want from a box.  Y'all think it would be good?  Anyways I would love recommendations to check out before I drop the money, also I have a budget of $150 though cheaper can be better so you don't nesscarily have to go right up to the budget. 

&#x200B;

(Side note, I was wondering are all these TC and special chips mainly for people building and wanting to use a regulated box or are there a lot of pre made coils that can take advantage of these things, after all I wouldn't want to be paying for something I can't take advantage of)",Fri Oct 19 05:51:24 PDT 2018,vaginalfisting
t3_9pjgt9,RTA Recommendation Request,"Im using a squonk mod with a Wotofo recurve. The recurve is honestly the most smoothest vape Ive ever had. 

Another positive is the ease in installing a coil. I can change the coil and wick in under minute.

But I have major issues with leaking when I travel. I cant just throw it down, or even lay it down on the passenger seat whilst driving. It's not the the atty's fault, just general downside of open top attys.

Wondering if there is an RTA with similar feel to the Recurve, and also ease of installing a coil.

I see the Kylin mini has a similar curve design to the Recurve.

As the title says, I'd like to hear from anyone who has experience with this device.

Considering it popped up last year, there haven't been any news on it recently, but I'm looking to swap my current Joyetech AIO for this Aramax.

I'm mostly curious if it starts leaking or if any problems appear after a prolonged amount of time since most reviews/videos I've seen only used it for 2 weeks or so and that's generally not enough time to judge a ""No-name"" brand, in my opinion.

Thanks in advance.",Fri Oct 19 04:45:54 PDT 2018,nandi910
t3_9piszf,RIP my first mod,"It was about 5 months ago I got my first mod at the local vape shop. Bought a Smok T Priv and generally had a great experience except for their shitty tank. The moment I dropped it cast a slow death spell. It rattled a screw out the top and I was able to fix it for a while. Then the screw housing gave out completely with only one screw to hold the top on place. The last week I was looking at new mods since I felt the end coming. Sure enough I had the mod next to me and I knocked it over and put enough force on top to break the other screw housing. Now the top flops around with wires attached.

RIP Smok T Priv. We had some good times, I liked your weird look and glowing lights. 

Got a Vaporesso Revenger X on the way, should look nice with my Firemax Mesh Pro",Fri Oct 19 04:08:25 PDT 2018,Xerosnake90

t3_9pifr2,Autofire with the Aegis Legend,"Hello ecig community.

I have a bit of a problem. I've had the Geekvape Aegis Legend for about 2 months now and except for the early battery drain that was fixed by the firmware update I haven't had any issues with it. That is until this week. 

I have been using the usb port of the Legend to charge my batteries because it is much easier then to plug them into a battery dock every time they are empty plus I have only one pair of batteries. They are Sony VTC5A's if anyone is curious.

My problem is this. Last week I went to plug the vape to my laptop for charging but when I put in the USB cable it started to autofire and wouldn't stop until I pulled out the cable, tried to turn it off first didn't work. No issues after that. Now not even 10 minutes ago it happened again except now it continued when I pulled it out and only stopped when I turned it off.

My question is is this thing safe to use anymore? What if it happens when it's in my bag and starting to autofire when charging with a powerbank. Is it a firehazard? Do I just leave it to chill for awhile or don't use the USB charging anymore?

I don't want to use it anymore and went back to my ego but it sucks to vape on it compared to my digiflavour.

Any tips in this situation appreciated.",Fri Oct 19 03:07:52 PDT 2018,HyperionMoon

The first day and a half or something it was pretty damn good and after that is when the problem started. It slowly started decreasing in amount of 
 vapor till a point where the throat hit became unbearably harsh and there was little or no vapor coming out when I take a drag.
I thought maybe it was a flooded coil so tried out few tricks like purging, removing the coil and gently blowing into the top to get rid of excess liquid, but didnt work. Also replaced both the ""O Rings"" on the mod with the replacement ones in the box still no luck.
Then I learn that there's a possibility of faulty coils sometimes. So then went and bought myself another pack of coils but the same thing is happening.
Coil is good for about a day or day and a half of medium vaping and after that it's downhill till the point of no vapor at all, just a kind of hiss and an occasional pop sound.

t3_9pfqn2,Upgrade and a thought.,"Its been a while since I've upgraded any of my stuff.  A few years ago I found what I like and stuck with it.  The button on my sigelei finally starting showing signs of wear so I looked around and found a pair that I liked.  But damn I loved that mod, I ran it over with my truck twice lol. 

I ended up getting a  Reuleaux RX Gen3 Dual and a Creed RTA.  The only issue I have with the rta is that the colored o rings they supply are only for the bottom oring, which is weird.  No biggie but wanted to know if others only got colored o rings for the bottom of the tank? 


Now on to the thought.   I put coils in and juiced up and started vaping.  Took a while for the flavor to come in.  Kept vaping, and I asked my gf to check it out. I asked her if she tasted anything and she said yea, made 200 mls of cereal which we have been enjoying very much.  My issue has always been that I like my vape really thick and wet.  Almost spitting back at me.  I've always had an issue with juice tasting somewhat dry, kind of like cotton but more just a dry flavor.  Now I've always noticed that the dry taste/smell always seemed to form kind of above my soft pallet.  Kind of between your throat and nasal passage, weird I know.  So we sat down and started watching tv, and for whatever reason I kind of blocked that passage so I was only exhaling through my mouth and ya know what!  I didn't taste or smell that dry hit feeling.  So weird that I've been vaping for 8 or 9 years and always had that issue unless I am vaping a menthol/mint flavor.  

Anyway I thought what was really odd but cool that I figured out why I always had that taste.

t3_9pfq5p,PIZZA DAVE DELIVERS - A RTA REVIEW - THE LOTUS BY HUGSVAPE,"**INTRODUCTION**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello everyone, Pizza Dave here, delivering a review of the [Lotus RTA](https://www.sourcemore.com/hugsvape-lotus-rta-rebuildable-tank-atomizer-rainbow.html) by Hugsvape. I had not heard of this company up until very recently, but they appear to be hitting the vape scene hard with some solid atomizers. The Lotus has been out for just a little while now. It is a compact, dual coil RTA, which features bottom air flow, a post less deck, and a pop open filling mechanism. Let’s dive down, look at the deck, how it vapes, and as always, I will see you down at the bottom for my final thoughts.

DISCLAIMER: This RTA was sent to me by Sourcemore for review.

&#x200B;

**BUILD DECK AND WICKING**

The build deck of the Lotus features a post less design. Building on this isn’t the best for beginners as it takes a bit of experience to know just what to do when you first see this deck. The post holes are inward w/ set screws coming in from the sides. I found it best to prebend the coils, so the leads come off one side, and place them so they are near the middle. At first this appears to be very simple to build on, but I found the chimney to be very low set and will contact the coils if you are not careful. I found that a 6 wrap, 2.5mm Clapton was the max I could fit, and the leads had to be snipped so it sat just a hair above the deck. With a chamber this small, it isn’t a deal breaker, as it doesn’t require huge builds. You just must keep it in mind when building. Wicking on this rta takes a bit of patience as well. The wicking slots are on the outside of the deck, and they are not very large.  To help get it right the first time, thin the wicking with tweezers, cut to a length just below the deck, and saturate with liquid prior to reassembly. The liquid will help the wicks to stay tucked into place when you screw it all together.  Even though the wicking itself takes some patience, once it is in place it wicks well. I never had dry hits on the 3 builds I installed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**AIR FLOW**

The Lotus RTA has an air flow system that is a bit different. It comes up the bottom, but the deck shapes the air flow to wrap around the bottom and sides of the coils. The feel of this air flow is very smooth, and not too airy. At wide open it is a nice lung it that has a little bit of restriction to it. It provides a smooth draw that has an excellent feel to it. I never closed it down as wide open was just right for me. If you do elect to close it down a bit, you’ll find the AFC ring to be nice and smooth, and locks either closed or open. I can’t stand when an AFC ring is too loose or too tight, so this one gets a pro for being just right.

&#x200B;

**HOW IT VAPES**

One big pro for the Lotus is the flavor it produces. It doesn’t need huge coils and doesn’t need a ton of power (60w for me) to produce a nice flavorful vape experience. I wanted to hate this thing based on the build deck and wicking out of the gate, but once I vaped it I forgave a lot of the issues it has. It is compact yet holds 5ml of liquid with the bubble glass. Another big pro is the wicking, as I never had issues with leaking or dry hits. I honestly felt I totally bombed the wicking and was going to have a bad time, but every time it worked the way it should. I wicked it very very thin every time, and not a single leak, even when it laid on it’s side overnight (by accident).

&#x200B;

*One note about my album.  Don't try the coils I attempted in the build shown.  These were 3mm 7 wrap fused claptons.  They shorted against the chimney, so that is when I first found I had to go with a smaller ID and take one wrap off.  The 7 wraps still fit, but that extra wrap didn't leave any room to get wicks out the ends and down.*

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Hugsvape deserves a bit of a hug from me, because they produced a heck on a rta with this. It has a few cons that I must point out. The build deck is compact and doesn’t offer a lot of room for coils and the wicking takes some patience to get tucked in just right as I mentioned above. The last con is the slide and pop open top. It has a tiny little latch on top, so you slide a hair, and pop the top open to refill the fill ports. Every time I put this in my jacket pocket, it would pop open. It takes the slightest little bump and way it goes. Just a little larger latch or tighter seals would have went a long ways with this. However, once you get past the cons, you will find a laundry list of pros. The thing is one of my favorite looking RTAs to come out this year. The air flow is silky smooth. It provides a great tasting vape. It has 5ml of liquid capacity, all while being a relatively small rta. There are easily enough pros with this to overpower this little cons.

OVEN TEST:

If this RTA accidentally went in the pizza oven, would I go out and buy another? For sure. One of the biggest contributors to that is a super low-price tag of just $30. At that price, it is worth it to just buy it and try it out.

REVIEW CRITERIA: I use each item extensively for about two weeks to ensure I have collected enough data to adequately write a review. I use the same e liquid in tanks or rdas throughout all my reviews to ensure that I am comparing apples to apples between all modern equipment. I do not post reviews until I feel confident that I have used all products enough to give an educated review.  The reason I started doing reviews was due to poor purchasing decisions in my vaping infancy about two years ago. Back then, I purchased several different pieces of hardware without really enjoying them and I hope my reviews can guide people into spending their hard-earned money more wisely than I did! \*\*\*\*Keep in mind that some items I receive may be pre-release and not in retail packaging. Quality may be less than the finished product and what is in the package may differ from the retail package as well.",Thu Oct 18 19:30:56 PDT 2018,pizzadave80
t3_9pfmqm,VO Tech VIA240 - A review from the Darkcide,"Today I'll be presenting the VIA240 by [VO Tech](https://vo.technology/). It's a dual 18650 regulated device powered by what I assume to be the same VO 240W chipset in the USV Mach On3 but in a different package. This device was provided by VO's sister company USV for purpose of review but that will not affect my ability to provide a 100% honest review. It is available directly from [USV](https://www.usvofficial.com/) for $80.00 or can be found at many popular retailers. It comes in a six different designs. There's [Goat](https://imgur.com/a/U3V6NRQ), [Jinn](https://imgur.com/a/duwCd43), [Shield](https://imgur.com/a/RcDL8KT), [Joker](https://imgur.com/a/PirzX0Z), [Zombie](https://imgur.com/a/jztbqlk), and [Species](https://imgur.com/a/f05ViAU) which I'll be reviewing. The device allows you to swap between the different designs of shell which I'll get to later. Shells for the device cost $15.00 each.  

Manufacturers specs:

* Battery Supported: 18650(2)
* Screen Type: 0.91 OLED
* Power Range: 5W-240W
* Temp Control Range: 93°-315°C／200°- 600F°
* Input Voltage: 5V-1.5A
* Output Voltage: 1V-8.4V
* Resistance Supported: 0.1-2.0Ω
* Available Modes: POWER/BYPASS/TEMP
* Standby Current: <200 μA
* Temp Control coil supported: NI/TI/SS316
* Spring loaded 510 connector

The package features the cosmos all over it. There's a wire drawing case on the front that gives you a general idea what to expect of the device in terms of size and shape. It also subtly highlights the swappable case feature IMO. The top of the case features a stylized VIA240 and the bottom contains the VO logo. In the upper left you'll find a sticker that shows which design is inside. The backside has the manufacturer description and specs along with a real brief warning, some IG/hashtag info, the manufacturers address, and the device's serial number. 

[Packaging photos](https://imgur.com/a/qpOMa2Y)

Upon opening the box you'll find the device inside of a protective foam bag a box that contains a USB cord. It would have been more stunning to see the device sitting in the protective foam without the bag but I appreciate the extra effort put forth to protect the device. Underneath the foam there's the device's ""instruction manual"" that's actually a fold out sheet, a warranty card, and a social media contact card.

[Inside of the box](https://imgur.com/a/QEctSl6)

The first thing you'll notice taking it out of the box is the device is entirely made of plastic so it's incredibly light. It's very angular with curved edges to make it comfortable. Both sides feature the design while the rest of the device is black. There's a good feeling matte rubber coating to the entire device adding to its grip and killing all glare except for the exposed part of the frame between the top and bottom of the shell. It's hard to describe but the sides featuring the design are slightly texturized and upraised. Not enough to be annoying but enough to let you feel the lines and negative space of the design. The bottom has the VO logo in the center. All of the buttons, screen, and USB port are located on one side (Even though you can charge through the port please use an external charger). The buttons are very clicky and responsive. The screen is bright, sharp, and seems to have an anti-glare coating. Even though there is no option to adjust the screen's brightness it's easily visible in all lighting conditions. The 510 connector has a gold plated spring loaded center pin and is engraved with ""VO TECH VIA240"". You're not going to get a larger atomizer than 26mm on this one without overhang. All of the external tolerances are tight with no visible gaps and everything is solid with no rattling.

[Device with shell photos](https://imgur.com/a/LYaCs6W)

Both the top and bottom of the shell are held on by really strong magnets. There are little tabs on both sides of the shell to help guide them into place. You actually have to apply a decent amount of force to get them off so they're held in tight. A cool little touch that you'll notice is the VO logo on the bottom magnets. Threre's also a VO logo on the backside of the device. To access the battery door you'll have to remove the bottom of the shell. At the bottom of the actual device is a little hinged battery door. Slide the door out a little and it will drop down. There are + and - signs on the door to ensure proper battery orientation. I like the way they left the bottom of the design open by the door for battery venting.  

[Device without shell and shell photos](https://imgur.com/a/hotnXpH)

Just like the last VO chipset that I reviewed it feels very accurate and responsive. Press the fire button five times in rapid succession to turn the device on and off. There is no lock on this one so you may want to turn it off first if you intend on pocketing it. Like most devices now days It features power, temperature, and bypass modes. To switch between modes you hit the fire button three times. In power mode you're given Eco, Normal, and Sport modes to choose from. They're your low, medium, and high pre-heat settings respectively. To switch performance modes you hold the + and - buttons at the same time while in power mode. It does fractions of watts from five to ten watts but then can only be adjusted in one watt increments after which I like. Who actually uses fractions of watts anyways? Temperature mode handles nickel, titanium, and stainless but once again like that last VO chipset device that I reviewed there are no TCR settings. You can select your material type by holding the + and - buttons while in temperature mode. To change between C and F hit the fire button twice. Bypass mode safely mimics a series mech. Resistance is automatically detected. Both batteries are shown as one bar but there is a nice feature that isn't on any of my other mods. Underneath the battery it list your current remaining battery voltage in numeric form. The screen will power itself down after 15 seconds.

In conclusion this is a  solid well preforming device. The looks are probably going to be hit or miss with this one for most people. It's a little loud for those with simpler more refined tastes. I'm 50/50 myself when it comes to the different designs. As far as the Species design that I reviewed I'm in love. I'm a huge fan of biomechanical artwork so it strikes a nerve with me. My whole right arm tattoo is a biomechanical sleeve so while vaping with my right hand it seems like a natural extension. The option to change your vape's appearance for $15 is a good idea as well. Especially for people that are torn between two or three of the designs. Why choose one when you can affordably have them all? As with the last VO chipset that I reviewed I would have liked to have seen TCR settings on here for the temp fans. I'm not as hopeful about this one getting TCR as I was for the Mach On3 though because there's no mention anywhere of this device being updatable. It's very comfortable shape and size wise so no complaints there but I personally wish it was heavier. Being lightweight is far from a strike though so if you're looking for a lightweight device this may be the one for you.

Thanks to both VO Tech and United Society of Vape for sending me this device to review!",Thu Oct 18 19:17:16 PDT 2018,Darkcide666
